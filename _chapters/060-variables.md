title: Theme variables
slug: variables
abstract: This theme makes a number of variables related to chapters and parts available to markdown files and Liquid templates.
---

The `chapter-vars.html` helper sets a number of variables related to chapters and parts
which can be accessed in markdown files or Liquid templates.
It can also render the variables for inspection.

Parameters:
- `id`: The `page.id` of the chapter page for which to set variables.
- `slug`: The `page.slug` of the chapter page for which to set variables (ignored if `id` is passed).
- `withnum`: For performance reasons, chapter and part numbers are not computed unless `withnum` is `true`. (To compute only chapter or only part numbers, set `withnum=part` or `withnum=chapter` instead.)
- `inspect`: If true, render the variables to the page, for debugging.

To set variables for the current chapter:

{% raw %}
```
{% include chapter-vars.html withnum="true" id=page.id %}
```
{% endraw %}

Then access them like this: 

{% raw %}
```
Chapter number: {{ chapter_num }}
```
{% endraw %}

To inspect all the variables:

{% raw %}
```
{% include chapter-vars.html inspect="true" withnum="true" id=page.id %}
```
{% endraw %}

...which renders this:

{% include chapter-vars.html inspect="true" withnum="true" id=page.id %}
