## Human Security

Human security is an emerging paradigm that places ordinary people at the center of security concerns. In contrast to traditional notions of national security that focus on external military threats to the state, human security encompasses a broad range of issues that threaten the safety, livelihood and dignity of individuals. These issues include poverty, infectious diseases, natural disasters, unemployment, crime, social conflict and political repression. The concept of human security first gained prominence in the 1994 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Report, which argued that ensuring "freedom from want" and "freedom from fear" should be the foundations of human security.

## Debates & Unresolved Issues

The relationship between globalization and human security has sparked much debate. On one hand, globalization has facilitated the spread of liberal values, opened access to information, promoted economic development, and enabled greater interconnectedness. These trends can enhance human security by reducing conflict, alleviating poverty, and improving health outcomes.

However, globalization also creates tensions that undermine human security. Economic interdependence produces inequality and relative deprivation. The pace of change outstrips the capacity of societies and cultures to adapt. Globalization enables transnational threats like terrorism, organized crime, pandemics, and environmental degradation. It makes local populations feel threatened by outside cultural influences. These dynamics provoke social dislocation, ethnic tensions, and backlash against globalization.

The impact of globalization on human security thus appears contradictory. While enhancing aggregate wellbeing, globalization also disrupts traditional livelihoods and ways of life. Societies must balance pursuing economic opportunity while cushioning against insecurity. There are also debates around prioritizing different dimensions of human security - whether to focus on freedom from physical violence or broader human development needs. Global policy coordination is needed, but governance gaps persist between global markets and domestic institutions.

# Governance

Governance, both international and domestic, plays a crucial role in addressing human security concerns. International financial institutions, often constrained by bureaucratic divisions, must navigate conflicts among state donors. Additionally, power dynamics within these institutions can limit the influence of the Global South. Representation and accountability are key issues.

The shift from state security to human security following the Cold War has led to interdependence-driven coalition-building among states, NGOs, IGOs, businesses, and others for tackling diverse challenges. This collaborative approach has had some success in addressing refugee problems through burden-sharing and support for asylum countries. However, it also contributes to security dilemmas as states balance interests in human security with more traditional security concerns.

NGOs have spearheaded efforts on specific human security issues, leveraging their flexibility and connections with grassroots populations. They play a vital role in agenda-setting, research, and implementation of projects. However, their dependence on donor funding can hamper their effectiveness and sustainability. Coordination between NGOs, businesses, and governments remains a persistent issue in maximizing impact while avoiding duplication of efforts.

Overall, human security requires updated governance to fit an increasingly multipolar world. Both global and local institutions need reform to become more responsive, inclusive and accountable. A balanced approach is necessary, addressing human security without undermining international cooperation and state sovereignty.

# Theory of Human Security

Human security broadens the theoretical scope of security studies beyond traditional realist approaches. Perspectives like constructivism and feminism provide alternative frameworks for understanding threats and analyzing global issues.

Constructivism views security dilemmas as socially constructed and subject to change based on new norms and shared understandings. Rather than assuming that state interests are fixed, constructivists see interests and identities as malleable over time. This contrasts with rationalist theories that treat the structure of the international system as determining state interests. The social construction of security issues shapes how states perceive threats and define their interests.

Feminist theory also challenges realist assumptions by exposing masculine biases embedded in traditional concepts of security and power. Feminists argue that security has been falsely equated with national security and maintaining state sovereignty. This reflects men's historical control over the state and marginalizes women's everyday security concerns. Feminist scholars emphasize broadening security to include issues like domestic violence, economic inequality, and women's representation in government.

Both constructivist and feminist approaches demonstrate that the concept of security is subjective and grounded in social relationships rather than objective material conditions. Human security applies these insights by reconceptualizing security around the needs of individuals and communities. Theoretical perspectives like constructivism and feminism are vital to developing more holistic frameworks for understanding human security.

# Poverty

Poverty represents one of the most prominent issues within the human security agenda. The poverty-security nexus highlights the complex and reciprocal relationship between poverty and insecurity. Poverty contributes to a self-reinforcing cycle of instability, conflict, population displacement, and human insecurity. At the same time, conditions of chronic conflict and instability foster environments in which poverty persists and becomes entrenched. This nexus prompts the need for a nuanced understanding of the linkages between poverty and broader aspects of human insecurity.

Several key factors contribute to the poverty-insecurity cycle. The lack of basic needs, opportunity, and human development characteristics of poverty create grievances and vulnerabilities. This fosters unrest and opposition movements, prompting government repression and conflict. Such instability then becomes a driver of further poverty. Weak state capacity, often associated with high poverty levels, also enables non-state actors and criminal networks to gain influence. These illicit networks fund conflict, crime, and terrorism. As violence escalates, economic disruption further entrenches poverty. Additionally, the displacement of populations due to conflict areas of chronic poverty, disrupting livelihoods and welfare.

Human security strategies aimed at alleviating poverty and reducing conflict must account for these complex linkages. Sustainable approaches require strengthening state capacity to deliver public services, ensuring access to opportunity and social mobility, and promoting inclusive economic development and resilience. Initiatives should focus on rebuilding after conflict and preventing cycles of recurring violence that reinforce poverty. By addressing the multidimensional nature of poverty, human security policies can help break the cycle where poverty becomes both a root cause and a consequence of chronic insecurity.

# Health

Health has become an integral aspect of the human security framework. Traditionally, health was not viewed as a security issue. However, the broadening definition of security in the post-Cold War era has brought health concerns to the forefront. In particular, the spread of infectious diseases and the impact of HIV/AIDS have underscored the complex relationship between health and security.

Diseases that rapidly spread across borders, like SARS, H1N1, and COVID-19, have demonstrated how health issues can quickly become security concerns. The economic costs, social disruptions, and loss of human life caused by infectious disease outbreaks can destabilize communities and threaten state stability. As health issues transcend borders, they require coordinated global responses.

HIV/AIDS has significantly impacted security in the hardest hit regions, especially sub-Saharan Africa. The disease has depleted workforces, overwhelmed health care systems, and created generations of orphaned children. By weakening social cohesion and state capacity, HIV/AIDS has exacerbated existing security challenges and vulnerabilities. The scope and severity of the pandemic has made it a priority issue for development programs and foreign policy.

Bioterrorism has also emerged as a potential security threat in a globalized world. The prospect of biological agents being intentionally released to spread fear, illness, and death highlights the evolving nature of security threats. Preventing and preparing for such risks will be a key challenge going forward.

In addressing this expansive health-security nexus, the human security approach emphasizes collaboration and shared responsibility. Tackling complex health challenges demands multi-sectoral partnerships, from the community level up to global institutions. It also requires recognizing health as an integral component of individual and collective security.

# Population Movements

Population movements, both involuntary and voluntary, pose complex challenges related to human security. Involuntary movements, such as flows of refugees fleeing conflict, violence, or persecution, are a major component. According to the UNHCR, there were 26.6 million refugees globally at the end of 2020 - the highest level since records began. This underscores the strong linkages between conflict and refugee flows, as people are forced to seek security and opportunity elsewhere when their states cannot protect or provide for them.

The Syrian conflict has produced massive refugee flows, with 6.8 million refugees and 6.7 million internally displaced as of mid-2021. Neighboring countries like Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan have struggled to absorb and provide for these populations. Refugee camps often lack basic services, contribute to environmental degradation, and can become recruiting grounds for militants. Women and children face heightened risks of violence and exploitation.

Even once refugee flows subside, challenges remain around safe and voluntary repatriation. This requires rebuilding trust in the state and cooperation between origin and host countries. Refugees may be stateless or come from diasporas, complicating their status. Host countries like Bangladesh with the Rohingya face long-term impacts.

Beyond refugees, examining voluntary migrants can provide insight into world politics. Migrant populations maintain connections with their origin states, sending remittances and shaping foreign policies regarding their homelands. Diasporas have played significant roles in peace processes. However, migration also produces complex security tradeoffs. Terrorist organizations can exploit diaspora links or resentments among immigrant communities. Human trafficking generates immense profits from illegal migration.

Balancing human security with state security regarding population flows requires nuance. Individual rights and needs matter, but so do diplomatic considerations and practical constraints. No simple policy prescription exists, underscoring the need for context-specific solutions that account for diverse perspectives.
