## Introduction

Security has been a heavily debated concept within International Security Studies (ISS), evolving significantly from its origins in post-World War II discussions on protecting states and societies from external and internal dangers. At its core, security encompasses the preservation of core values and freedom from threats for individuals, groups, and nations. However, there remains substantial disagreement within ISS on the primary focus and scope of security, whether it should center on safeguarding individual citizens, nation-states, the international system, or an emerging global society. 

During the Cold War, the predominant focus was on national security, emphasizing military capabilities to combat immediate threats, often blurring the lines between state and societal protection. The Cold War period solidified this conception, with security largely defined in relation to state power and external dangers. As the complexities of globalization emerged in the post-Cold War era, debates widened to incorporate political, economic, societal and environmental aspects of security. The introduction of transnational issues like terrorism, financial crises, climate change and cyberattacks highlighted the interconnectedness of security across borders and the potential need to shift from national to international or global perspectives. This evolution challenged traditional notions of security centered on military force and urgencies of danger and protection.

Discussions now wrestle with the compatibility of national, international and global security, and whether the proper focus should be the security of states, societies, individuals or humanity collectively. Theories like realism continue to view powerful nation-states as the key actors in global affairs while alternative perspectives emphasize the role of communities, institutions, shared ideas and gender identities. As security discourse continues to be contested and revised in complex ways, a comprehensive understanding requires examining the conceptual origins of security and how perspectives have shifted over time in response to new threats, technologies and global relationships.

## Internal vs External Threats

During the Cold War, there was a notable shift in focus from internal, domestic threats to the prominence of external threats in conceptualizations of national security. In the early postwar period, countries were largely preoccupied with internal economic recovery and stability. However, the onset of the Cold War quickly changed this focus towards perceiving the communist Soviet Union as the primary external threat. 

As tensions escalated between the Western and Eastern blocs, led by the United States and Soviet Union respectively, the threat of nuclear war and communist expansionism came to dominate security thinking. Countries aligned with the West saw communism as an ideological and existential threat. This worsened fears of domestic communist movements and influence as constituting an internal danger.

The rise of the Cold War led to security being equated with building military power to deter the external communist threat. By the 1960s, massive buildups of nuclear and conventional arms characterized the security policies of both superpowers. The space and arms race between the two blocs further entrenched this external focus. Domestic policies and spending increasingly centered on resisting external communist encroachment.

This evolution marked a foundational shift in the concept of national security towards emphasizing external rather than internal threats. The predominance of the bipolar struggle meant security was defined in opposition to the rival bloc rather than driven by internal economic or political goals. This created a dichotomy between national security and domestic policy that would have ramifications long after the end of the Cold War era.

## National vs International Security

The compatibility of national and international security has been questioned in contemporary discussions. Some argue that national and international security are inherently incompatible concepts. According to this view, states will always prioritize their own national security interests over broader international security concerns. As a result, collective action problems persist in addressing global security challenges, as states remain unable or unwilling to make sacrifices for the greater international good.

However, others reject the notion that national and international security are incompatible. They contend that it is possible to align national security interests with wider international security objectives. In their view, enhancing international security can also bolster a nation's own security. For example, mitigating threats like climate change, nuclear proliferation, and terrorism requires broad multilateral cooperation across states. Therefore, working to further international security can serve national security interests.  

Advocates of this perspective cite security communities and international institutions as evidence that national and global security can be mutually reinforcing. Alliances like NATO demonstrate that states can sometimes sublimate purely national interests to further collective defense and common values. International organizations like the UN Security Council also provide mechanisms for reconciling national prerogatives with international responsibilities for peace and security.

According to this viewpoint, the interconnectedness of the modern world requires reconceptualizing national security in more international terms. Globalization means that few security threats can be addressed unilaterally today. While tensions remain, there are increasing incentives for aligning national security strategies with international security priorities.

## Global Security

The emergence of an embryonic global society in the post-Cold War era challenged the appropriateness of a narrow focus on national or international security. Increased globalization introduced new risks that were not limited by national borders, requiring a broader conceptualization of security.

Some of the key risks that emerged in the post-Cold War era as a result of globalization included international terrorism, breakdowns in the global monetary system, global warming and associated climate change, cyber conflicts and hacking that could disrupt critical infrastructure, and the heightened dangers of nuclear accidents or mishaps with global implications. 

Whereas national security focuses on protecting the interests of a particular nation-state, and international security examines security dynamics between nation-states, global security encompasses security threats that affect the entire world. This includes risks tied to the global commons - domains that lie outside national jurisdiction such as the oceans, space, and the internet. Threats within these domains require cooperative solutions between nation-states.

Global security risks also highlight the interconnectedness of countries through complex interdependence. With deepening globalization, risks and threats can quickly spread transnationally through economic, environmental, health, and information channels. This suggests that no single country can achieve absolute security within its own borders without considering the security of other nations. 

Some scholars argue that global security should focus primarily on protecting people rather than states. This human security approach emphasizes security challenges related to inequality, infectious diseases, environmental degradation, migration, and human rights abuses. It examines how these issues undermine the safety, dignity, and livelihoods of individuals worldwide.

Overall, the post-Cold War era necessitated an evolution in thinking from national security to global security. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected through globalization, security can no longer be viewed through a narrow national lens. A global perspective recognizes that one country's insecurity often spills over to affect others, requiring cooperative solutions to manage emerging transnational threats.

## Theoretical Perspectives on Security

**Realism** has been one of the dominant theoretical perspectives within ISS. It views states as the key actors in an anarchic 'self-help' world where power is the currency. For realists, military capabilities are central to security, and power balancing is critical to prevent potential hegemony. Realism advocates that states focus on their national interests and maximize their relative power capabilities. It has been criticized for an overly state-centric view that downplays non-military dimensions of security.

**Liberalism** offers an alternative perspective, with institutional liberalism arguing that international institutions can promote security through cooperation, collective security, democracy, and economic interdependence. Institutions help mitigate anarchy's constraints, facilitate cooperation using international law and norms, and make the costs of non-cooperation higher. However, critics argue that liberal institutionalism is too optimistic about progress through interdependence and democracy. 

**Constructivism** provides a starkly different take by arguing that core aspects of international relations are socially constructed rather than given by nature. The identities and interests of states and other actors are not predetermined but are shaped through social interaction. Thus, constructivists focus on the role of identity, norms, and ideas rather than just material capabilities. Changing social structures, including the nature of threats and appropriate responses, can transform international politics.

## Alternative Perspectives 


**Critical theories** adopt a reflective stance to security by questioning mainstream assumptions and perspectives. They aim to reveal how practices and discourses surrounding security can disadvantage or harm particular groups. Feminist approaches in ISS emphasize how gender relations and masculinities are embedded within global politics and security practices. Post-structuralists focus on how language and knowledge shape our understanding of threats and appropriate policy responses.

**Feminist perspectives** shed light on the often overlooked gender dimension in international security. They recognize that war and conflict have differential impacts on men and women. Women are disproportionately affected by violence, displacement, and the breakdown of social services during conflict. However, women are often excluded from formal peace processes and post-conflict reconstruction. Feminist scholars argue that incorporating gender perspectives can lead to more inclusive and sustainable security policies.

**Post-structuralist** views challenge dominant security discourses that privilege the nation-state and military responses. Changing the discourse around security may fundamentally alter international politics. Post-structuralists contend that security should focus on emancipating individuals rather than empowering states. This involves critically examining the language and social structures that contribute to conflict and instability. Post-structuralism opens space for diverse voices and perspectives largely marginalized in traditional security studies. It encourages questioning underlying assumptions and power dynamics inherent in mainstream security paradigms.
