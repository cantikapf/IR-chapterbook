## Introduction

The rise of judicial mechanisms in trade diplomacy since the 1990 s represents a significant transformation in how international trade issues are resolved between nations. During this period, traditional diplomatic approaches that relied on direct negotiation between parties began to lose effectiveness. As a result, judicial procedures and institutions have progressively replaced standard diplomacy as the primary means of settling trade disputes and advancing trade cooperation. This shift reflects a new paradigm in trade relations, one that favors rule-based adjudication through impartial third parties over purely political deal-making between national governments.

The new prominence of judicial mechanisms marks a departure from decades of trade diplomacy based on conventional negotiation tactics. Whereas such diplomacy depended on leverage, bargaining, and the threat of retaliation, judicial approaches introduce binding legal rulings as well as compulsory procedures. This removes the possibility for nations to simply withdraw from the process if they find the outcome unfavorable. The rise of judicialization has compelled states to resolve their differences within a legal framework, even when traditional diplomacy fails to yield agreement. While not eliminating political negotiation entirely, legal recourse now serves as an underpinning of trade relations between nations in the modern era.

## The Importance of Judicial Mechanism

Traditional diplomatic approaches to negotiating and enforcing trade agreements have yielded progressively less fruit over the past two decades. As a result, judicial mechanisms are increasingly coming to substitute for traditional diplomacy, perhaps if only by default. 

Where diplomatic negotiations often stall due to disagreement or lack of compromise between parties, judicial mechanisms provide more definitive rulings and pathways for dispute resolution. Their legally-binding nature also provides greater incentives for compliance.

Overall, the rise of judicial mechanisms signals a shift away from achieving trade cooperation solely through traditional diplomacy. With negotiations yielding diminishing returns, countries seem more willing to turn to third-party adjudication to advance their trade interests. The substitution of judicial processes appears to be happening gradually but steadily.

## Judicial Process for Dispute

Judicial processes have become much more important not just for resolving trade disputes but in advancing trade cooperation. As traditional diplomatic approaches have become less effective in recent decades, countries have increasingly turned to judicial mechanisms to settle disagreements. 

Rather than relying solely on bilateral negotiations, states are now more willing to submit disputes to third party adjudication. Independent arbiters can provide definitive rulings to conclusively settle conflicts. This shift towards legalistic procedures aims to promote trade cooperation.

By agreeing to abide by judicial decisions, countries open pathways for resolving issues that could otherwise stall trade relations. Even when disputes inevitably arise, the judicial process offers a structured means of reaching equitable solutions. An emphasis on rule of law and transparency through open hearings can also foster greater trust between trade partners.  

Overall, the growing judicialization of trade disputes serves the larger goal of advancing mutually beneficial economic ties. By committing to impartial rulings, states gain assurances that their interests will be protected. This adherence to fair judicial standards provides stability for further cooperation.

## Judicialization Objectives

Judicialization appears to focus diplomacy on smaller, narrower objectives initially: bringing a complaint against another government for depriving one of benefits from trade under an international agreement, negotiating a resolution, or winning the adjudication of a particular dispute.  

The emphasis is on resolving specific disagreements through a judicial process rather than engaging in broad negotiations. Judicialization compels governments to address narrow, well-defined conflicts through formal complaints, targeted negotiations between the parties, and rulings by impartial adjudicators.

Diplomacy becomes centered on obtaining favorable judgments in trade disputes rather than mutually acceptable bargains between governments. There is less flexibility for negotiators to maneuver or make concessions. The aim is to win each case rather than achieve a larger diplomatic compromise across issues.

## Differences Between Diplomacy

Judicialization is genuinely different diplomacy, in that governments can no longer opt out if they dislike a ruling. Unlike in bilateral or multilateral negotiations, there is not the option of a BATNA, no real choice to withdraw from negotiations. Judicialized trade diplomacy, like more traditional types, can be either positive-sum or adversarial, but in a different way. Both sides in a dispute are compelled to negotiate, to accept judgments, to implement rulings. There is an arbitration element present in which the judicial process, whilst not substituting for the essentially diplomatic nature of the interaction between states, has become a permanent part of negotiation.

## ECJ Model

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) established a binding legal mechanism for resolving trade disputes between EU member states starting in 1952. This came after the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) Treaty, which first created the ECJ. The ECSC was the precursor to the European Economic Community (EEC), established in 1957. 

The ECJ served an important role in the new European community by creating a way for member states to resolve trade conflicts through legal procedures. If diplomatic negotiations failed between states, the ECJ could step in as a backstop to adjudicate the dispute. This made the ECJ the first permanent supranational judicial institution with real power.

The ECJ's binding judgments set precedents in EU trade law. Its mission was to ensure proper interpretation and equal application of ECSC treaty provisions in all member states. While the ECSC only involved a limited number of economic sectors related to coal and steel, the EEC expanded this framework to all economic sectors. As the EEC evolved into the EU, the ECJ expanded into a full judicial system spanning all areas of EU policy and law.

By establishing the ECJ in the 1950 s, the founders of the European community paved the way for binding legal dispute resolution between states. This model of a permanent trade court with compulsory jurisdiction would later inspire the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement understanding in the 1990 s. The ECJ proved that judicial procedures could supplement traditional diplomacy in resolving complex trade conflicts.

## ECJ as Backstop Where Negotiation Failed

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) served an important function as a backstop in the event that diplomatic negotiation between EU member states failed to resolve a trade dispute. When countries could not reach agreement through traditional negotiation, they had the option to escalate the dispute to the ECJ for a binding legal ruling. 

This judicial backstop changed the nature of trade diplomacy within the EU. Countries could no longer simply walk away from negotiations if they were dissatisfied. The threat of legal action through the ECJ compelled member states to make greater efforts to find mutually agreeable solutions through negotiation.

At the same time, the availability of eventual recourse to the ECJ meant that negotiations did not have to go on endlessly. If talks reached an impasse, the judicial process could break the logjam.

The ECJ did not completely substitute for diplomatic negotiation. Its role was more as a permanent part of the interaction between member states. The presence of a judicial backstop promoted more meaningful bargaining in the shadow of potential litigation.

This demonstrated that binding third party dispute resolution could act as a catalyst and complement to inter-state negotiation. The model pioneered by the ECJ would later influence the design of dispute settlement in the WTO and other trade agreements.

## WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism Strengthened in the 1990s

The establishment of a strengthened dispute settlement mechanism was a key accomplishment of the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. The WTO introduced a newly enhanced Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) that built upon and improved the previous GATT dispute system. 

Under the WTO, dispute settlement is administered by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), consisting of all WTO members. The DSB has the authority to establish dispute settlement panels, adopt the reports of panels and the Appellate Body, oversee the implementation of rulings, and authorize temporary retaliation if a country does not comply with a ruling.

A major innovation of the WTO dispute settlement system is that rulings made by the adjudicative bodies are binding upon the parties. If a defendant is found to have violated WTO commitments, they are obligated to bring their policies into conformity with the ruling. The WTO system also introduced a standing appellate body to review legal and substantive aspects of panel reports. 

By establishing a rules-based system with binding dispute rulings and an appeals process, the WTO dispute settlement mechanism represented a significant strengthening compared to the previous GATT system. This judicialized approach helped provide greater security and predictability in the multilateral trading system. The substantial increase in cases brought under the DSU demonstrated the growing importance of this judicial mechanism in resolving trade conflicts.

## Override Domestic Law with WTO/NAFTA 

The dispute resolution mechanisms of both the WTO and NAFTA have broad authority to override domestic laws within member states. This is a crucial power that enables these trade bodies to enforce their rulings and create more uniform policies among members.  

Specifically, when a trade dispute ruling is made against a member state, that country is compelled to change its domestic laws and regulations to comply, even if politically difficult. For example, if a WTO panel rules that a member's import tariffs on a certain product violate WTO commitments, that country must rescind the tariffs, overriding its own domestic laws that implemented them.

Similarly, under NAFTA's dispute settlement provisions, if a NAFTA tribunal decides a member state's policies or actions violated NAFTA and nullifies expected benefits, that member must comply by amending or repealing the inconsistent domestic measures. This controversial power to trump member states' domestic laws has been critical to enforcing freer trade under WTO and NAFTA rules.
