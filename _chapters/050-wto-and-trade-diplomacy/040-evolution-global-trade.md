## Introduction

International trade refers to the exchange of goods, services, capital, and labor across international borders and territories. Over the past two centuries, international trade as a percentage of total global economic output has grown substantially, from around 2% in the early 19 th century to nearly 35% today. This dramatic increase reflects the indispensable and inescapable role that trade has come to play in the global economy. It enables people across the world to work, earn a living, consume goods and services, and invest the returns from their labor.

Without international trade, global economic prosperity would not be possible. The substantial growth of trade relative to overall economic activity represents the increasing necessity for people worldwide to engage with one another across borders. Trade requires overcoming differences and doing business together. In this sense, the expansion of international trade serves as a metaphor for greater human connection and exchange globally.

## A Dynamic of World Trade 

International trade as a percentage of world economic output has grown remarkably over the past two centuries, from approximately 2% in the early 19 th century to nearly 35% in the year 2000. This dramatic rise in the prominence of international trade relative to overall global economic activity serves as a powerful metaphor for the increasing necessity for people and nations across the world to engage with one another. As trade has expanded to encompass a larger share of the world's economic interactions, dealing with global differences and doing business across borders have become inescapable aspects of economic life.

The expansion of international trade illuminates the deepening interconnectedness of the global economy. Where once most economic production was limited to domestic consumption, now the economies of even far-flung nations are inextricably linked. Supply chains snake across multiple countries, raw materials are shipped from one continent to be manufactured in another, and finished goods are sold in markets worldwide. This dense web of economic interdependence has enabled greater specialization and efficiency in production, allowing access to a wider array of goods and services. But it has also made nations and people vulnerable to economic shocks originating far away. The dramatic increase in trade has created a world where local economic prosperity is tied to global cooperation and the ability to work within an interconnected market.

## Diplomacy: Fundamental and Essential Human Activity

Diplomacy that makes international trade possible and profitable is no longer just about nation-state governments, bilateral trade liberalization treaties, multilateral trade organizations, and FTAs. Diplomacy has enabled trade since ancient times as a core agenda item for diplomats. Trade has not only been a primary object of diplomatic representation and communication but also understood as the exchange of goods, services, capital, and labor. 

Today, diplomacy involves a wide range of actors beyond just governments to facilitate international trade. Multinational corporations, industry associations, non-governmental organizations, and even individuals engage in diplomacy through communications and negotiations. Both state and non-state actors aim to further their interests and agendas through diplomatic channels. This complex web of diplomacy between diverse actors has become essential to enabling the expansion of global trade.

## Trade Contributes and Redistributes

Trade creates value through specialization and realizing economic efficiencies in production. However, trade also redistributes wealth, assets, and power both within and between countries. The ongoing process of trade brings social change, which can address or worsen inequality and the distribution of wealth between economic sectors, regions, and social groups. 

On the one hand, trade allows countries to specialize in industries where they have a comparative advantage. This division of labor increases overall productivity and wealth. Consumers also benefit from lower prices and greater variety of goods. 

On the other hand, trade can negatively impact certain industries, regions, and workers who face greater competition. Jobs may be offshored to countries with lower costs of production. Some communities can experience long-term decline as traditional industries fade. Workers may need to be retrained and transition to new careers.

The impacts of trade liberalization are often uneven within a country. Urban areas with skilled workers tend to benefit most from access to global markets. More vulnerable rural populations or declining industrial regions can be harmed by import competition. Trade policy has distributional consequences that can exacerbate geographic or skill inequalities.

Between countries, increased trade has facilitated economic growth in emerging markets but also intensified competition for developed economies. Wealthier nations push for greater access to developing country markets but restrict imports of agricultural goods and labor-intensive products. At the same time, poorer countries seek fairer trade rules and arrangements they see as more equitable. 

Overall, international trade creates significant economic benefits but also reshapes economic power and opportunities. The gains from trade are real but so are the disruption costs borne by certain groups. The diplomatic challenge is mediating these complex effects to share prosperity more inclusively and equitably.

## New Diplomatic Studies: Its Paradigm 

A new diplomatic studies paradigm illuminates these processes by focusing not only upon the negotiation and politics of trade agreements but also upon the ongoing diplomatic representation and communication required to manage trading relationships. The diplomatic studies perspective highlights that trade diplomacy is not just focused on finalizing trade agreements, but requires consistent relationship management between countries through political engagement and communication channels even after agreements are made. This ongoing diplomacy facilitates cooperation and mediates conflicts that arise from the complex dynamics between trading partners.

Developing positive diplomatic relationships and clear communication pipelines between nations is just as critical as the technical details within trade accords themselves. The new paradigm recognizes that trade partnerships evolve over time with shifting political and economic landscapes. Adaptability based on strong connections between countries allows trade to continue flourishing. Diplomatic studies examines both the short-term negotiations and long-term relationship management that enables international commerce.

## Emergence of Non-State Actors

The diplomatic studies perspective on international trade highlights developments such as the emergence of non-state actors, including global firms and civil society organizations that now act as diplomatic actors in their own right. 

Whereas diplomacy was previously confined to interactions between nation-state governments, economic globalization has empowered multinational corporations to engage directly in trade discussions and negotiations. Major companies often rival the economic power of countries, granting them significant bargaining leverage.

Similarly, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) focused on issues like labor rights, environmental protection, and consumer safety have obtained more access to trade deliberations. Using media campaigns and lobbying, NGOs attempt to shape trade agreements, sometimes forming unusual alliances with business actors.

This changing nature of diplomatic "actorness" creates complex multistakeholder negotiations, as governments balance national interests with corporate and civil society demands. The rise of non-state actors highlights how trade diplomacy now involves diverse participants beyond just state officials.

## Thinking About Trade Diplomacy

### New Actors and Institutions

The ways that diplomatic representation and communication are undertaken have profound effects on the diplomacy of international trade and commerce. The emergence of new diplomatic actors beyond just nation-states is changing trade diplomacy. Non-state actors like multinational corporations and NGOs now engage in their own diplomacy and are reshaping the landscape. New venues and institutions for diplomacy focused on trade are also forming, from bilateral and regional trade agreements to global forums like the WTO. 

The combined impact of these new actors and institutions is transforming trade diplomacy. No longer the sole province of nation-state foreign services engaging in periodic trade talks, trade diplomacy now involves continuous negotiation and communication between diverse state and non-state actors across various levels. This is creating both opportunities and challenges for achieving trade goals, requiring creative diplomacy to navigate an increasingly complex web of relationships. Fundamentally, the nature of trade diplomacy is shifting with the changing nature of diplomatic actor-ness in the 21 st century.

## Thinking About International Trade

### Impact of public diplomacy 

Public diplomacy is becoming increasingly important in international trade. With the rise of global communications and social media, the general public has greater awareness of and ability to influence trade negotiations and agreements. This gives civil society groups and individual citizens more power to shape the debate on trade policies. Governments engaging in trade diplomacy must be mindful of public opinion back home as well as in partner countries. Skilled use of public diplomacy through press releases, social media, and stakeholder engagement can build support for trade deals. Failure to convince the public of an agreement's merits can derail ratification, as happened with the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the United States. 

### Diplomacy balancing trade and other issues

Trade diplomacy often requires balancing trade priorities with other policy goals such as environmental protection, labor standards, and intellectual property rights. For example, trade negotiations may need to reconcile differing national standards on patent terms that impact access to medicines. Or countries may link trade access to commitments on reducing carbon emissions. Diplomats must creatively craft agreements that advance commercial interests while meeting non-trade objectives. This involves understanding partner negotiating positions and identifying mutually agreeable compromises. Countries unwilling to compromise on non-trade issues can obstruct deals. Diplomats play a vital role using negotiation and persuasion skills to produce balanced agreements acceptable to diverse domestic and international interests.

## Problem for Diplomacy 

A fundamental challenge for diplomacy surrounding international trade is mediating between sovereign powers that have differing interests. Nation-states use their power and influence on the diplomatic stage to advance their own interests and priorities, as defined by their governments. These sovereign states are generally unwilling to cede power to other entities unless they can be persuaded that doing so aligns with their interests. 

As such, a key problem diplomacy must solve is finding ways to bring together estranged powers with divergent goals. Diplomats must identify shared interests and incentives that allow sovereign states to work together, despite their differences. This requires nuanced communication, negotiation tactics, and creative compromises that satisfy various parties' core priorities. Skillful diplomacy can uncover common ground and make cooperation mutually beneficial, even between states that seem to have little in common. The evolution of international trade relies on diplomats' ability to turn national interests toward collective gains.

## Diplomacy Today: Support to Trade Growth

The use of diplomacy to facilitate international trade today appears as a challenging paradox. On the one hand, international trade flourishes: trade growth is a driving force behind the explosive economic growth in emerging economies from Asia to Africa to Latin America. 

Yet at the same time, much of the diplomacy that takes place within the institutional structures established to facilitate trade expansion, such as WTO, seems to underperform expectations. Negotiations often stall or fail despite strong incentives for their success. Representation of interests and communication between trading partners seem inadequate to bridge differences in interests.

The ubiquity of real-time communication channels, which make it much easier for non-state actors and the global public to be aware of and participate in trade diplomacy, also makes that diplomacy much more difficult. The public visibility of negotiating positions and debates makes compromise or flexibility more politically difficult for governments. This exacerbates the structural difficulties inherent in trade negotiations between sovereign states with asymmetric economic size or influence.
