## Introduction

International trade refers to the exchange of goods, services, and capital across national borders and territories. Historically, international trade emerged and evolved gradually, expanding in scope and scale over the centuries. In the early 19 th century, international trade accounted for around 2% of total global economic output. However, by the year 2000, the share of international trade had risen dramatically to approximately 35% of the world's gross domestic product. 

This steady growth underscores the rising indispensability of international trade as a core component of the global economy. Trade enables people worldwide to find employment, earn income, produce goods and services, and invest and consume the fruits of economic activity. Without the flows of international trade, global economic prosperity on the scale witnessed today would not be feasible. The steep increase in the ratio of trade to overall economic output symbolizes the growing necessity for diverse populations across the world to connect, overcome differences, and engage in commercial exchange and business relationships with each other.

## A Dynamic of World Trade

International trade today has become an indispensable component of the global economy that enables prosperity worldwide. As a percentage of global economic output, international trade has dramatically increased from around 2% in the early 19 th century to nearly 35% in 2000. This growth exemplifies the increasing necessity for interconnectedness between people and nations across the world. They must engage with each other's differences and unique attributes to conduct fruitful business relationships and trade partnerships. The significant rise of trade relative to overall economic activity serves as a metaphor for the growing global interdependence required to foster mutual understanding and facilitate value-generating exchanges. Trade now ties together the world's populace so they may work, earn livings, and consume and invest the fruits of their collective productivity. In essence, the remarkable expansion of trade reflects the inescapable needs for diverse societies to collaborate, resolve conflicts, and create win-win scenarios that enable worldwide economic prosperity.

## Diplomacy: Fundamental and Essential Human Activity

Diplomacy is a fundamental and essential human activity that enables international trade. Without diplomacy between nations, trade could not take place in the orderly and mutually-beneficial fashion that has allowed the modern global economy to develop and thrive.  

Diplomacy provides the communication channels, negotiation frameworks, and representation of national interests that allow countries to come together and establish the treaties and agreements that govern international trade. It facilitates the relationships and understandings between nations that make cross-border business transactions viable and profitable. In essence, diplomacy lays the groundwork that enables international commerce and financial flows to occur.

Throughout history, diplomacy has been a prerequisite for trade and economic exchange between different cultures and sovereign territories. Whether along ancient trade routes like the Silk Road or in today's complex web of multinational supply chains, trade has relied on diplomatic efforts to build intercultural understanding and align the interests of diverse parties. Diplomacy allows economic opportunities to be identified and pursued jointly for mutual benefit. It provides the basis for countries to collaborate rather than compete when it comes to trade.

Simply put, international trade depends on diplomacy. Diplomacy creates the open channels of communication, mutual trust, and negotiated compromises between nations that enable goods and services to be exchanged across borders to the betterment of global prosperity. It is a fundamental building block of the international trade system.

## Trade or Exchange Contribution

International trade creates value through specialization and the realization of economic efficiencies. Countries are able to focus on producing goods and services where they have a comparative advantage. This allows for greater overall output and productivity gains. 

However, trade also redistributes wealth, assets, and power both within and between countries. The opening up of trade changes the composition of economic activity in a country. Some sectors, regions or social groups may benefit more than others from trade. This can exacerbate income inequality as workers in non-competitive sectors face job losses or lower wages. Trade liberalization may also shift economic and political power between regions or groups.

Overall, trade brings broad economic gains through efficiency and specialization. But it also inevitably brings structural change and redistribution within an economy. Managing the impact of these changes on different segments of society is an important policy challenge. Trade policy has distributional effects, creating winners and losers. The overall net benefits must be weighed against the costs of transition, unemployment and inequality.

## New Diplomatic Studies Paradigm

A new diplomatic studies paradigm illuminates these processes by focusing not only upon the negotiation and politics of trade agreements but also upon the ongoing diplomatic representation and communication required to manage trading relationships. 

This new paradigm recognizes that trade diplomacy involves more than just negotiating trade agreements. It requires ongoing diplomatic engagement between countries to foster strong trading relationships over time. 

After trade deals are struck, diplomats play a key role in representing their countries' interests, communicating concerns, and troubleshooting problems in the trading relationship. They help smooth out any issues that arise and keep the flow of trade and benefits strong between the partners.

Diplomats act as the "boots on the ground" in sustaining productive trade relationships. Their representation and communication fosters better understanding between countries, builds trust, and prevents minor trade disputes from escalating into larger conflicts. 

With robust diplomatic ties, trade partners can voice disagreements while preserving an overall spirit of goodwill and win-win collaboration. This allows the economic gains from trade to continue over the long term.

## The Emergence of Non-State Actors in Trade Diplomacy 

In recent decades, the landscape of international trade diplomacy has expanded beyond traditional state actors. Non-state actors like multinational corporations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) now play an increasingly prominent role.

Multinational firms engage in their own form of commercial diplomacy to pursue business opportunities across borders. They negotiate partnerships, investments, and trade deals independent of any single national government. Corporations have the resources and incentive to lobby foreign governments directly and influence regulations that impact their operations.

At the same time, NGOs have emerged as advocacy actors in their own right on issues related to trade. Groups dedicated to labor rights, environmental protection, consumer safety and more seek to shape trade policies. NGOs directly petition governments and multilateral organizations. They also rally public pressure through grassroots campaigns and protests. Activists view trade deals about more than economics, but social and ethical impacts as well.

The growing influence of these non-state actors has transformed modern trade diplomacy. Negotiations now involve multifaceted interests beyond narrow national positions. Corporations and NGOs also provide critical on-the-ground expertise. Overall, the emergence of non-state actors makes trade diplomacy more complex but also more inclusive of diverse global voices.

## Thinking About International Trade 

### How do the ways that diplomatic representation and communication are undertaken affect the diplomacy of international trade and commerce in particular?

International trade diplomacy is undergoing significant changes as new diplomatic actors emerge on the global stage. Traditionally, trade diplomacy was conducted solely between national governments through official channels. However, globalization has led to the rise of powerful non-state actors like multinational corporations, business associations, and NGOs. These new actors are able to directly influence and shape trade negotiations and outcomes. 

Similarly, the venues for trade diplomacy have expanded beyond closed-door bilateral and multilateral negotiations. Digital communication enables broader participation of diverse stakeholders in trade debates. Public relations campaigns and social media activism now play a role in building consensus or opposition to trade agreements. This open trade diplomacy presents both opportunities and challenges for achieving negotiated outcomes.

Overall, the diversification of actors and communication channels is transforming trade diplomacy. It is no longer an insulated activity dominated by national governments. Today's complex trade diplomacy involves networks of state and non-state actors collaboratively or competitively shaping narratives, norms and policies. Managing this new diplomacy requires understanding the priorities of these various stakeholders and how to effectively communicate and negotiate in an interconnected global landscape.

The rise of public diplomacy has had a major impact on the diplomacy of international trade. With greater public scrutiny and input into trade negotiations thanks to real-time digital communications, trade diplomats now must engage and persuade multiple domestic and international audiences. This complicates deal-making between governments, as public opinion and special interests exert greater influence. Trade diplomats today need communications skills as much as negotiating skills to explain the benefits of trade deals to the public and build a consensus. The proliferation of new digital tools presents opportunities for public diplomacy around trade, but also risks if misinformation spreads. Overall, the growing role of public diplomacy has made striking trade deals more challenging but also more inclusive if done right. Trade diplomacy now has higher standards of transparency and engagement to meet public expectations in the digital age.

## Problem for Diplomacy

Diplomacy must often mediate between sovereign and estranged powers. Nation-states use their power on the diplomatic stage to advantage their interests and priorities, as perceived by their governments. Governments are unlikely to cede power to others unless they can be persuaded it serves their interests. 

Diplomats face the paradox of facilitating agreements between parties with radically different perspectives and priorities. Each seeks to maximize its own interests, making compromise challenging. Yet compromise is essential for agreements that benefit all.

Skilled diplomacy can uncover shared interests and values between competing parties. It can identify potential gains from cooperation that outweigh losses. Through dialogue and negotiations, diplomatic efforts can build mutual understanding and identify mutually beneficial solutions.

Patience and persistence are key. Outcomes are rarely immediate. But over time, diplomacy can transform adversarial relationships into partnerships. It can replace suspicion with trust, conflict with cooperation. But this requires a commitment to principles of equality, empathy and good faith from all sides.

## Diplomacy Today: Supporting Trade Growth Despite Communication Challenges

The use of diplomacy to facilitate international trade today appears as a challenging paradox. On one hand, international trade continues to flourish - trade growth remains a driving force behind the explosive economic development in emerging economies across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. 

Yet at the same time, much of the diplomacy undertaken within institutional structures established to enable trade expansion, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), seems hampered. Negotiations stall, disputes drag on, and agreements face arduous ratification processes.

Part of the difficulty lies in the complexity of modern trade diplomacy. Trade negotiations now go beyond tariffs and quotas to encompass areas like intellectual property, environmental standards, labor regulations, and more. This increases the number of domestic interests and stakeholders invested in trade policy outcomes.

Additionally, the ubiquity of real-time communication channels enables non-state actors and the global public to closely monitor and weigh in on trade diplomacy. This transparency provides valuable oversight, but also introduces pressures from special interests that can impede negotiations.

Diplomats undertaking trade diplomacy must balance a wider array of considerations from a more vocal set of participants. Effectively facilitating international trade growth relies on envoys adept at building consensus across a diverse spectrum of voices. Adaptability, inclusion, and nuance represent key diplomatic skills for enabling trade expansion in the 21 st century.
