## Introduction 

The Bretton Woods conference, named after its location in New Hampshire, represented a pivotal moment in reshaping the international monetary system following World War II. Attended by delegates from 44 allied nations in July 1944, the gathering sought to establish a new framework for economic cooperation and currency stability. 

Led by British economist John Maynard Keynes and U.S. Treasury official Harry Dexter White, the negotiations ultimately yielded agreements to create several key institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), now known as the World Bank. The new system also introduced features like fixed but adjustable exchange rates pegged to the U.S. dollar.

Known as the Bretton Woods monetary order, this framework went on to dominate global finance for almost 30 years. Despite its eventual breakdown in the early 1970s, Bretton Woods profoundly influenced post-war policies and organizations aimed at fostering international financial cooperation.

## Background

The Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 emerged against the backdrop of restrictive economic policies and challenges in the preceding decades that demonstrated a need for a new global economic system.  

In the years leading up to World War 2, nations operated under the gold standard which pegged currency values to gold. This resulted in limited currency availability and inflexibility which constricted governments' abilities to respond to economic crises. 

The Great Depression of the 1930s revealed the weaknesses of this system. With currencies pegged to gold, governments had little power to stimulate their economies, leading to rampant unemployment and poverty. The gold standard prevented nations from expanding money supplies or lowering interest rates to spur growth.

World War 2 placed further strains on the global financial system. Combatant nations suspended gold convertibility and rapidly increased money supplies to finance the war, causing inflation and economic instability. 

By the warâ€™s end, it was clear the pre-war economic order was no longer tenable. Nations like Britain began exploring alternatives to the gold standard that would provide more currency stability and flexibility.

This set the stage for the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, which aimed to establish a new framework for international monetary relations better equipped to handle post-war challenges. The resulting Bretton Woods system would govern currency regulations, exchange rate management, and monetary cooperation for decades to come.

## Bretton Woods Conference

The Bretton Woods Conference was held in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire in July 1944. It brought together 730 delegates from 44 allied nations to establish a new post-war international monetary system. 

The key attendees were John Maynard Keynes, representing the British Treasury, and Harry Dexter White, representing the U.S. Treasury Department. Other notable attendees included the heads of the central banks of France, China, and India.

The overarching goals of the conference were to:

- Promote international monetary cooperation 
- Establish exchange rate stability
- Facilitate economic growth through free trade

To achieve these goals, the conference sought to create new institutional frameworks and regulations for the post-war global financial order.

The key outcomes of the conference were:

- The creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), now part of the World Bank Group. The IMF was tasked with overseeing the new system of fixed exchange rates, providing short-term loans, and monitoring the global economy. The IBRD was created to finance post-war reconstruction and development projects. 

- The establishment of a system of fixed exchange rates pegged to the U.S. dollar, which was convertible to gold at $35 per ounce. This "Bretton Woods system" allowed currencies to fluctuate within 1% of the fixed rate.

- Member nations were assigned quotas that determined their voting power and access to IMF loans based on their economic power. 

- The conference charter was formally ratified at the final plenary session on July 22, 1944 after 3 weeks of discussion and debate.

The Bretton Woods Conference laid the groundwork for the post-war international economic consensus of embedded liberalism, which favored an open global economy with regulations and institutions for stability.

## IMF and World Bank

The Bretton Woods conference led to the establishment of two major global financial institutions - the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), now known as the World Bank. 

The IMF was established with the purpose of overseeing the new system of fixed exchange rates and providing short-term capital to aid balance of payments. It also aimed to foster global monetary cooperation and secure financial stability. The IMF would monitor economic and financial developments and provide policy advice to member countries. 

The World Bank's roles were focused on post-war reconstruction and development. It provided longer-term loans aimed at rebuilding war-torn economies and infrastructure. Over time, its mission evolved towards poverty reduction and advancing sustainable economic growth in developing countries.

The establishment of these twin institutions was pivotal in the new global economic order conceived at Bretton Woods. The IMF and World Bank continue to play important roles in international finance, economic development and global governance, although not without criticisms of some policies and practices. Nonetheless, they were foundational entities that emerged from the vision for stability and growth outlined at the conference.

## Adjustable Peg System

The adjustable peg system established a rules-based order for exchange rate management. Participating countries pegged their currencies to the U.S. dollar, which was convertible to gold at $35 per ounce. This helped stabilize exchange rates within a 1% band. 

Countries agreed to maintain exchange rates within 1% of parity by buying or selling their own currency on foreign exchange markets as needed. If faced with fundamental disequilibrium, they could adjust the parity rate with IMF approval.

The adjustable peg system brought order and stability compared to the volatility and competitive devaluations of the 1930s. It allowed fluctuations to correct temporary imbalances while providing stability and averting wide swings. This encouraged trade and investment flows, supporting post-war reconstruction and growth.

Quota subscriptions also played a part. The IMF set quotas for member countries reflective of their relative economic power. This determined voting shares in the IMF and how much foreign currency a member was obligated to provide. Quotas became central in financing IMF lending programs.

The U.S. dollar served as a reserve asset and medium of international exchange under Bretton Woods. Together with the adjustable peg system and quotas, an institutional framework of rules and procedures was established to govern currency relations. This new monetary order facilitated stability and growth in the post-war era.

## Dollar Hegemony

In the years following the establishment of the Bretton Woods agreements, the post-war monetary system proved unstable. Many nations struggled to maintain the value of their currencies against the US dollar under the adjustable peg system. This resulted in the rise of what became known as **dollar hegemony**. 

With its strong manufacturing base and abundant gold reserves, the United States emerged from WWII as the dominant economic power. As such, it took on the role as the main manager of global monetary affairs. The US facilitated open markets, provided economic aid, and backed its currency with gold under the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system. 

This new arrangement saw America's allies accept the hegemonic monetary system in exchange for mutual economic benefits and cooperation. By taking the lead in global economic matters, the US was able to solidify its position as the preeminent world power. 

Under dollar hegemony, the US could act unilaterally to secure its own interests, while still permitting allies to benefit. US allies gained access to US capital markets and the ability to run trade deficits.

This unique "bargain" allowed the system to endure for decades, despite mounting costs for the US. But by the late 1960s, the strains began to show. Challenges such as other nations trading excess dollars for gold put increased pressure on the system. Ultimately, the Bretton Woods regime built around dollar hegemony could not last indefinitely.

## End of Bretton Woods

The Bretton Woods system came to an end in the early 1970s due to a confluence of factors that made the fixed exchange rate regime untenable. 

A major stress on the system was the high costs of the Vietnam War, which forced the U.S. to run persistent balance of payment deficits. To fund expenditures abroad, the U.S. printed more dollars. As the dollar supply expanded, the fixed exchange rate to gold became unsustainable.  

Many countries became concerned about the overvaluation of the dollar and began to trade in their dollar holdings for gold, depleting U.S. gold reserves. This "gold drain" and dollar overhang undermined faith in the dollar's value and ability to serve as the reserve currency.

In addition, other economies like Germany and Japan recovered quickly after WWII and became competitive exporters. Their economic growth put pressure on the fixed rate system. There were also challenges with speculative capital flows undermining exchange rate stability.

By the late 1960s, the U.S. was unable to meet its gold conversion obligations. With dwindling gold reserves, the dollar was overvalued relative to its gold equivalent. Efforts by the Federal Reserve to contract the money supply and defend the dollar's peg led to periodic recessions.

In August 1971, President Nixon unilaterally ended dollar-to-gold convertibility, thereby triggering the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. Currencies began floating against the dollar. This allowed governments more autonomy over their domestic monetary policies and exchange rates.

The demise of Bretton Woods gave way to a new era of flexible exchange rates, greater capital mobility, and increasingly globalized financial markets. The dollar retained its status as the primary reserve currency under a system of floating rates.

## Bretton Woods II 

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, some economists proposed a modified international monetary system that came to be known as Bretton Woods II. This was discussed at a G20 meeting in 2009 in response to the global financial crisis.

The idea behind Bretton Woods II was to realign currency exchange rates to reduce trade imbalances. Specifically, it called for countries with trade surpluses to increase domestic demand and allow their currencies to appreciate, while countries with trade deficits should act to decrease domestic demand and allow their currencies to depreciate. 

Advocates argued this would help restore balance and stability in the global economy, similar to the original Bretton Woods system. However, there was disagreement among nations on the specifics. The 2009 G20 meeting concluded with declarations to avoid protectionism, support open markets, and achieve balanced growth, but did not lead to a formal realignment of exchange rates.

While not an officially enacted monetary system, the concept of Bretton Woods II reflected ongoing discussions about the need for coordinated international monetary cooperation in an increasingly globalized economy. The original goals of currency stability and reduced trade imbalances continued to be relevant decades after the first Bretton Woods order ended.

## Legacy 

The Bretton Woods system had a significant and lasting impact on the global economy. By establishing a framework for international monetary cooperation, it facilitated cross-border trade and investment. This promoted economic growth and integration in the post-war era. 

Some key legacies of Bretton Woods include:

- Providing currency stability through pegged exchange rates. This reduced volatility and uncertainty in foreign exchange markets.

- Fostering cooperation between nations on monetary issues. The IMF and World Bank provided forums for policy coordination. 

- Promoting free trade and open markets. Bretton Woods laid the groundwork for multilateral trade agreements like GATT and the WTO.

- Shifting economic power to the United States. Bretton Woods established the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency. This gave the U.S. unmatched influence over global finance.

- Creating institutional support for international finance. The IMF and World Bank evolved into key organizations for financial assistance and development.

- Catalyzing European integration. Bretton Woods pushed European nations to coordinate monetary policies, paving the way for the EU.

So in many ways, the original Bretton Woods framework shaped international economic relations for decades. It drove globalization and interdependency between economies. Most experts agree that Bretton Woods was a milestone in modern economic history, despite its eventual demise.

## Summary

The Bretton Woods conference in 1944 sought to rebuild the international monetary system following World War II. It established the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to promote stability and economic cooperation. A system of fixed exchange rates pegged to the U.S. dollar was introduced, reflecting the dollar's new status as the dominant global reserve currency. 

This "Bretton Woods system" remained in place for over 25 years. However, the costs of the Vietnam War and other strains ultimately led to its collapse in 1971. The major currencies began floating against each other, and this new era saw the rise of high inflation and unstable exchange rates.

In the 2000s, some called for a "Bretton Woods II" system to restore stability to currency markets in the wake of the global financial crisis. While this did not come to pass, the original Bretton Woods institutions continue to play important roles today. The conference was a defining moment that shaped global economics and governance for decades to come.
