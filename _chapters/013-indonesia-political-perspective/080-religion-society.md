## Introduction

Since 2005, Indonesia has witnessed numerous direct elections of local government heads in provinces, districts, and municipalities. A notable trend in these elections is the formation of ethnic coalitions, with political party activists asserting that voters tend to favor candidates from the same ethnic background, particularly when their group constitutes a significant majority in the region. This phenomenon has resulted in a notable convergence between ethnic population patterns and ethnic identity, as highlighted by scholars like Edward Aspinall, Sebastian Dettman, and Eve Warburton.

## Religion and Politics

The intertwining of religion and politics has been a subject of scrutiny in Indonesia. President Joko Widodo proposed a separation of religion and politics during the Jakarta gubernatorial run-off election. Religious leaders, such as Mustofa Bisri and Quraish Shihab, attribute the rise of a hardline understanding of Islam to the presence of leaders claiming a monopoly on truth. 

Emphasizing the need for constant re-examination and re-learning of religious texts, religious leaders argue for a nuanced interpretation relevant to the contemporary context. Mustofa Bisri contends that no one can claim a monopoly on interpreting religious texts. He highlights the importance of exercising wisdom and embedding values like justice, compassion and humanity when examining scripture. 

Similarly, Quraish Shihab advocates for a contextual understanding of religious texts, taking into account the socio-historical circumstances in which they were revealed. He cautions against a rigid reading and asserts that Islam respects freedom of thought and democratic values. According to Shihab, religion should shape ethics and morality, not politics.

Leaders like Bisri and Shihab provide a counterpoint to hardline voices, advocating nuance over dogma. Their perspectives showcase the diversity of religious thought in Indonesia, beyond those claiming a monopoly on truth. By emphasizing contextual relevance, they attempt to curb the weaponization of religion for political ends.

## Medan Case Study:

Medan provides an interesting case study into the interplay between identity politics and communal tensions in local elections. In the city's recent run-off mayoral election, communal solidarity and religious affiliations emerged as more pronounced factors than ethnic considerations. 

This was highlighted in the campaigns of Sofyan Tan, a minority Buddhist, and Rahudman Harahap, a Muslim candidate. Despite their different ethnic and religious backgrounds, Tan received significant support from Muslim voters while Harahap drew support across ethnic lines. This phenomenon of **"identity switching" reflects the complexities of identity politics in Medan's diverse society.**

Rather than voting solely along ethnic lines, Medan's citizens displayed **communal solidarity that crossed ethnic factors.** Religious affiliations and perceived moral integrity proved decisive. Candidates who could appeal across ethnic and religious divides gained an advantage. 

Medan's diverse religious makeup, with Protestant Toba Bataks, Muslim Mandailing Bataks, and variations within the Malay community, showcases this **unique interplay between identity politics and tensions.** In the fluidity of the political arena, group identities are strategically emphasized and de-emphasized. But ultimately, overarching communal solidarity triumphed over narrow ethnic interests in Medan.

## Diverse Religious Landscape

Medan's diverse religious makeup highlights the intricate dynamics of identity politics in Indonesia. The city has a large **Toba Batak** population, who are predominantly **Protestant Christians**. The **Mandailing Batak** community, on the other hand, is largely **Muslim**. 

There are also variations within the broader Batak and Malay groups in Medan. This diverse religious landscape serves as a microcosm of Indonesia's complex patchwork of ethnic and religious identities.

Political actors must navigate and appeal to this multifaceted social fabric. The intermingling of ethnicity and religion means political mobilization involves strategic emphasis and selection of identities. Candidates build coalitions by appealing to specific ethnic and religious blocs at opportune moments.

Medan thus showcases how identity can be fluid and instrumental in the political sphere. As groups converge and split over ethnic, religious and other affiliations, political entrepreneurs manipulate identity politics to gain electoral advantage. This highlights the nuances and difficulties of managing diversity in Indonesian democracy.

## Strategic Identity Politics

In the religiously and ethnically diverse city of Medan, political actors strategically emphasize particular identities to gain maximum political advantage. This phenomenon highlights the malleability of identity in the political sphere. 

During elections in Medan, candidates form coalitions and appeal to specific ethnic or religious groups that can provide a strong voter base. For example, Sofyan Tan, a Buddhist candidate, aligned with Muslim leader Rahudman Harahap to broaden his voter appeal. Tan emphasized his Chinese heritage when campaigning in Chinese communities, but downplayed it in Muslim areas, showcasing how politicians modulate ethnic and religious identities for political gain.

The diverse Medan electorate leads candidates to strategically accentuate aspects of their identity that resonate most with different voter demographics. Identities are not fixed, but can be reframed and emphasized situationally to build coalitions and consolidate power. As evidenced in Medan, identity is malleable in the political arena, with actors selecting and projecting identities instrumentally to maximize electoral advantage. The strategic mutability of identity politics in Indonesia's diverse society is exemplified in microcosm in Medan.

## Conclusions

Medan provides an insightful microcosm for understanding the broader patterns of ethnic and religious politics in Indonesia. With its diverse mix of ethnicities and faiths, Medan highlights the complex interplay between identity politics and electoral mobilization in the country. 

The strategic emphasis on certain identity markers during elections, as seen through the Medan case study, showcases how identities can be fluid and malleable in the political sphere. Political actors selectively utilize religious, ethnic, or other markers of identity that give them the most electoral advantage.

This phenomenon reveals the need for nuanced examination of identity issues in diverse societies like Indonesia. Simple narratives or assumptions should be avoided, given the multifaceted nature of identity. As Medan demonstrates, the dynamics of identity and electoral politics involve complex factors of history, demography, communal relations, and more.

Moving forward, the intertwining of religion and politics in Indonesia requires thoughtful analysis that avoids polarization. Nuanced understanding of the country's diverse identities and their role in the political arena will be crucial. Medan provides one glimpse into these intricate dynamics, but much more examination is needed of the complex relationship between identity politics and democracy across Indonesia. Most importantly, the diverse voices within each identity group must be heard in order to develop holistic solutions that serve the shared interests of all communities.
