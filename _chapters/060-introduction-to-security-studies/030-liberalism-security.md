## Introduction

Liberalism is a political ideology centered around values like individual freedom, political participation, private property, equal opportunity, and free will. In the context of security studies, liberalism refers to a set of theories that aim to promote peace and cooperation between states. 

Liberalism envisions a world where democracy, economic integration, and international institutions help states overcome mistrust and avoid violent conflict. The liberal peace encompasses the idea that principles like open markets, rule of law, and democratic norms foster security and prosperity.

Various strands of liberal thought contribute to our understanding of how to construct a more peaceful world order. Liberal theories argue states can transcend conflict and competition through embracing tenets of democracy, economic interdependence, and institutionalized cooperation.

## Traditional Liberalism

Traditional liberalism emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries during the Age of Enlightenment. Key thinkers such as John Locke, Adam Smith, and Immanuel Kant developed foundational ideas about human nature, political systems, economics, and morality.

A core tenet of traditional liberalism is an optimistic view of human nature. Liberals believe that human beings are inherently reasonable and capable of benevolence. While humans may act selfishly at times, their nature is not necessarily evil or vicious. With the proper social and political institutions, liberalism holds that humans can be compelled to act for the greater good.

In terms of political systems, traditional liberals advocate for representative republics over pure democracies or aristocratic rule. Republics that balance popular rule with checks on power tend to negotiate solutions during conflicts rather than resorting to war. Without the drive for glory or conquest of monarchies, republics have less incentive for maintaining massive militaries and initiating wars. Their emphasis on civic participation and discourse leads republics to resolve disputes through discussion and compromise.

 **Foundation for peace based on traditional liberalism:** 
1. Republican civil constitution of every state
2. Law of nations founded on a federation of free states
3. Law of world citizenship limited to condition of universal hospitability

## Commercial Liberalism

The core argument of commercial liberalism is that economic interdependence between countries reduces the likelihood of war. This idea emerged from the critique of mercantilism in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Mercantilism was the dominant economic ideology in Europe, which held that nations should hoard gold and establish colonies to export more than they imported. In contrast, liberal thinkers argued that trade among nations is mutually beneficial rather than a zero-sum competition.

Several key insights underpinned this critique:

- **Douce Commerce Theory**:  Trade among states was mutually beneficial
- **Comparative Advantage**: David Ricardo's theory stated that nations prosper by focusing production on areas where they have a relative efficiency edge, and trading for other goods. This promotes economic specialization and peaceful exchange.
- **Division of Labor**: Adam Smith argued trade allows nations to divide labor, increase overall productivity, and reduce conflict. His concept of the "invisible hand" suggested that in an open economy, individuals pursuing self-interest can benefit society overall.

Later thinkers like James Mill and Joseph Schumpeter built on these ideas, noting how the social changes from capitalism reduced the influence of aristocratic and military elites inclined toward war. Overall, commercial liberalism proposes that the economic incentives of trade and open markets promote peace between nations.

## Democratic Peace Theory

The Democratic Peace Theory posits that democratic regimes are less likely to initiate violent conflicts against other democracies. This theory emphasizes how democratic processes, institutions, and norms promote compromise and discussion over aggression when dealing with other democracies.  

Some key aspects of the Democratic Peace Theory are:

- Democracies tend to avoid wars with each other due to shared norms and compromise through institutions like legislatures and elections. 
- The public nature of decision-making in democracies facilitates signaling and credibility between democratic leaders. This increases trust and resolve in negotiations compared to more opaque autocratic regimes.
- Liberal states tend to trust other liberal states and expect to resolves conflict through discussion and compromise
- Liberal democratic states do not fight war against other liberal democratic states. that's why democratic states spread democratic liberal ideology to other states

## Neoliberal Institutionalism Promotes Peace Through International Cooperation

Neoliberal institutionalism argues that international institutions play a vital role in reducing conflicts among democratic states. According to this theory, institutions help guarantee trust between countries by redefining state roles and acting as arbitrators. 

Institutions allow for more cooperation by providing highly institutionalized settings that reduce transaction costs and alter payoffs for peaceful interactions versus conflict. States can more easily find mutually beneficial solutions through the framework of international institutions.

Specifically, institutions promote peace among democracies by facilitating communication, negotiation, rule-setting, and enforcement. They create repeated games, reciprocity, and reputation building between states. Institutions also discourage democratic states from abandoning cooperation since it would harm their standing.

Additionally, institutions disseminate information to reassure states and reduce uncertainty about others' motives. They monitor state behaviors and punish violations, mitigating security dilemmas. Institutions align expectations, signal benign intentions, arbitrate disputes, and verify compliance.

## Case Studies

### NATO as an Example of Security Institution

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is often cited as an example of a security institution that has persisted beyond its original purpose. NATO was formed in 1949 as an alliance between North American and European countries to counter potential Soviet aggression during the Cold War. However, even after the end of the Cold War and dissolution of the Soviet Union, NATO has endured as a key security institution.

Unlike a traditional military alliance, NATO has established intergovernmental structures including a Secretary General, international staff, and integrated military command. It has also adapted its mission from purely collective defense to include crisis management, cooperative security, and partnership. NATO has formal decision-making processes and its members engage in regular diplomatic coordination and joint military planning and exercises. This institutionalization has enabled NATO to outlive the Cold War threat.

## Levels of Analysis

Waltz's analysis argues that the causes of conflict and cooperation exist at three different levels: individual, state, and international system. At the individual level, human nature and the decisions of leaders play a role, where liberal thinking holds that human nature is not inherently vicious. The state level examines how domestic politics, ideologies, and institutions shape a state's external behavior and interactions. For example, liberal theory contends that non-democratic regimes like dictatorships are more likely to initiate conflicts. At the international system level, the structure and distribution of power between states affects the likelihood of war and peace. A multipolar structure with many competing major powers tends to create more potential for clashes than a bipolar or unipolar structure. Overall, the interactions between the three levels of individuals, states, and global structure combine to determine patterns of conflict and cooperation according to liberal analysis.

## How suitable is neoliberal institutionalism with regard to security issue?

- Realm of security has special characteristic that make regime creation more difficult and increase it needs. States will establish an institution if they seek the goals that the institution will help them reach. In other words, institution do not do much to increase security
- Distinction between alliance and security institution is for example, NATO persisted after the end of the Cold War because it was not a simple alliance; rather it was a security institution
- Two ideal type security system: alliance and community of law
