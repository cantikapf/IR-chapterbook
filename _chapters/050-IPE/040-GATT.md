## Brief History

The World Trade Organization (WTO) was established in 1995, evolving out of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which had been in place since 1947. The transition marked a shift from a multilateral treaty to an international organization with defined membership. 

Unlike GATT, the WTO does not have a provisional application clause. It also expanded beyond GATT to cover additional areas like non-tariff barriers, trade in services, and intellectual property rights. The WTO also established a stronger dispute settlement system than was present under GATT.

Overall, the shift from GATT to the WTO represented an evolution from a set of multilateral trade agreements with limited scope into a formal international organization with a broader mandate governing world trade. This transition strengthened international cooperation on trade issues.

## Core Principles of the WTO

The World Trade Organization is guided by two core principles that shape its approach to facilitating international trade: market liberalism and non-discrimination. 

Market liberalism is the belief that an open, liberal international trade system leads to greater prosperity and improved living standards globally. This principle posits that removing barriers to trade allows countries to capitalize on their comparative advantages in production, enabling resources to be allocated more efficiently worldwide. Market liberalism has been a foundational philosophy underlying the multilateral trading system since the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

The principle of non-discrimination seeks to provide equal trading opportunities for WTO members. Several key tenets support non-discrimination:

- Most Favored Nation (MFN): Under MFN, if a WTO member provides a trade concession or advantage to one member, it must provide the same treatment to all other WTO members. This promotes equal trading rights.

- National Treatment: The national treatment principle holds that imported goods should be treated no less favorably than domestically-produced goods once they enter a country's market. This prevents discrimination against foreign products.

- Generalized System of Preferences (GSP): GSP provides special tariff concessions to developing countries without requiring reciprocity, supporting equitable trade opportunities.

By removing discriminatory trade policies, these principles enable all WTO members to compete on a level playing field in the global marketplace. Non-discrimination remains essential for fair and open trade under the WTO system.

## Decision Making

All rules and agreements in the WTO system emerge through intergovernmental bargaining, which is the primary decision-making process. This involves negotiations between member governments to liberalize international trade.

The aim of intergovernmental bargaining is to eliminate barriers to trade such as tariffs, quotas, and other restrictive regulations that impede the cross-border flow of goods and services. Through successive rounds of negotiation, governments make concessions by adjusting their domestic policies and regulations to align more closely with WTO principles. 

This gradual process of policy adjustment and rule-making is intended to achieve the goal of freer and more open trade among WTO members. Intergovernmental bargaining provides governments a forum to voice their interests and priorities, while working cooperatively to find mutually beneficial outcomes.

While decision-making is consensus-based, not every member has to agree to a deal for it to be approved. The negotiations allow compromises to be struck that balance different national interests. The bargaining process, though sometimes lengthy, allows the liberalization of trade to occur through cooperation rather than coercion.

## Power Dynamics

The stability of the WTO and international trade hinges on the distribution of power globally. **Hegemonic stability theory** explains shifts between open and closed trade periods based on the logic of public goods provision. **Hegemons, disproportionately powerful nations, bear the cost of creating international trade rules**, overcoming the free-riding problem. As a hegemon declines, the willingness to maintain trade rules diminishes, leading to less open world trade. 

**The enforcement problem**, hindering governments from being certain of others' compliance with trade agreements, is a challenge addressed by the WTO. It helps governments overcome this issue by providing the necessary information for employing reciprocity strategies in trade agreements.

## Perspectives on Existence 

There are two main perspectives on why the World Trade Organization exists in its current form.

The first perspective highlights the role of the United States as a postwar hegemon in establishing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the precursor to the WTO. As the global superpower after World War II, the United States had significant economic interests in creating an open international trade system. It also had the capacity and power to spearhead the creation of GATT. From this view, the WTO exists primarily because a dominant world power saw it as beneficial and was able to make it happen.

The alternative perspective focuses more on cooperation between nations for mutual gain. According to this view, the WTO facilitates governments working together to all benefit from increased international trade and economic integration. Rather than a hegemonic imposition, the WTO represents a forum for countries to collectively establish rules and norms for trade that provide shared advantages. Reduced trade barriers and increased market access allow each member nation to capitalize on its comparative advantages.

While the hegemonic and cooperative perspectives differ, they both see value in an organization like the WTO to create binding trade rules and settle disputes. The current incarnation of the WTO likely stems from a combination of US leadership in promoting open trade and the willingness of other nations to participate for their own economic interests. However, the continued existence and evolution of the WTO reflects a broad recognition of the gains possible through international cooperation on trade policy.

## Enforcement Challenge
The WTO helps governments overcome the enforcement problem in international trade agreements. The enforcement problem refers to the difficulty governments face in being certain that their trade partners will comply with trade agreements. This creates uncertainty and mistrust between trade partners. 

The WTO provides governments with the necessary information to employ reciprocity strategies in trade agreements. Reciprocity means matching your trade partner's level of compliance. If they uphold their end of the agreement, you do the same. If they violate the terms, you retaliate proportionally. The WTO enables this by monitoring trade policies and reporting violations. With full information on compliance, governments can confidently use reciprocity to minimize cheating and maximize cooperation in trade deals.

## Resolving Trade Disputes Through Dispute Settlement

The World Trade Organization possesses a robust dispute settlement mechanism for resolving trade disputes between member nations. This mechanism helps provide security and predictability to the multilateral trading system. 

Under the dispute settlement process, WTO members can initiate cases against countries adopting trade policies that allegedly break WTO rules or obligations. The Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) administers the process, establishing panels, adopting panel reports, monitoring implementation, and authorizing retaliation if a country fails to comply with a ruling.

Panels review and analyze evidence provided by parties to a dispute. They ultimately determine whether the trade measure in question aligns with existing WTO agreements. If it finds the measure inconsistent, the panel will recommend the member modify or remove it. 

The dispute settlement system prioritizes members mutually agreeing on a solution. If the countries cannot reach an agreement, parties can appeal a panel's ruling to the Appellate Body. The DSB adopts Appellate Body reports unless there is full consensus against adoption. If a country loses, it must follow the recommendations or face authorized retaliation from the winning party.

This binding dispute settlement process differs significantly from the diplomatic GATT mechanism. It provides WTO members a rules-based forum to efficiently resolve trade conflicts through legal procedures. The dispute settlement understanding is regarded as one of the WTO's crowning achievements.

## Trade in Services

The inclusion of trade in services under the WTO marked a pivotal departure from GATT. While goods comprise a major component of international trade, services make up an increasingly substantial portion of global economic activity. Rapid advancements in technology and communication have fueled the growth of trade in services in recent decades. Unlike trade in goods, services can be supplied through various modes - cross-border supply, consumption abroad, commercial presence, and movement of natural persons. 

Services account for over two-thirds of global output and employment across developed and developing countries. The expansion and liberalization of services trade creates new opportunities for firms and consumers while generating associated economic gains. However, barriers to trade in services like quotas, local content restrictions, and limits on foreign investment pose challenges. WTO negotiations aim to progressively remove these barriers and open services markets. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) provides the broad framework governing trade in services among WTO members. Key obligations in GATS include Most Favored Nation and National Treatment clauses. Members can voluntarily take on commitments to provide market access and national treatment for service sectors of export interest to trading partners.

## Intellectual Property Protections Under the WTO

The WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) established global minimum standards for various forms of intellectual property (IP) regulation. Member countries are required to have domestic laws compliant with TRIPS.

Some key areas of IP covered under TRIPS:

- **Copyright** - TRIPS sets a minimum copyright term of 50 years for most works, though countries can provide longer terms if desired. It also includes standards around exclusive rights of reproduction, translation, and distribution.

- **Patents** - Patent protection must be provided for both products and processes, for a minimum of 20 years. Patent rights allow the owner to prevent others from making, using, or selling a patented product or process. 

- **Trademarks** - Trademarks must be protected for at least 7 years, with the possibility of indefinite renewal. Rights holders can prevent unauthorized use of identical or similar trademarks that cause consumer confusion.

- **Industrial designs** - Industrial design rights cover the ornamental or aesthetic aspects of useful articles. TRIPS requires this protection last at least 10 years.

- **Trade secrets** - Undisclosed information with commercial value must be legally protected from disclosure and unfair commercial use. 

- **Geographical indications** - Identifiers that link a product's quality or reputation to its geographic origin must be protected against misleading uses.

By establishing these baseline IP protections, TRIPS aims to reduce impediments to international trade and promote effective IP rights enforcement amongst all WTO members. However, it has also faced criticism for restricting certain public interest flexibilities.

## Current Status 

The current status of the WTO is defined by stalled multilateral trade negotiations and tensions between developed and developing countries. 

The Doha Development Round of negotiations launched in 2001 aimed to lower trade barriers further and address issues important to developing countries. However, major disagreements have prevented consensus, leading to an impasse since 2008. Key issues blocking progress include agricultural subsidies and market access. Developed countries like the US and EU want developing countries to open their markets more but are unwilling to make major cuts to domestic agricultural subsidies. Developing countries argue this stance is unfair and hypocritical.

Several developing countries also view developed country policies on issues like intellectual property rights and services liberalization as detrimental to their interests. They claim the WTO favors rich country corporate interests over development priorities. Food security, affordable medicines, and industrialization are concerns for poorer nations. The WTO needs to balance further trade liberalization with policy space for development.

The stalled Doha talks and tensions between the developed and developing world have diminished the negotiating function of the WTO. Its dispute settlement system remains active but is facing criticism. The future path of the organization remains uncertain until major players can bridge differences on development policies and synchronize their trade agendas.
