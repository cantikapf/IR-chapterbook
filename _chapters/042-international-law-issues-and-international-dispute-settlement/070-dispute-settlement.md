Dispute settlement refers to the various methods states can utilize to resolve disagreements under international law. There are two main categories of dispute settlement techniques: diplomatic procedures and adjudication.

Diplomatic methods aim to reach mutually acceptable solutions through negotiation and third-party assistance. These flexible procedures include bilateral negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation, and good offices. Diplomatic techniques allow states to control the process and outcome.

Adjudication involves binding third-party decisions based on international law. This includes arbitration and judicial settlement through institutions like the International Court of Justice. Adjudication is more rigid but can definitively resolve legal disputes.

Overall, states have numerous options for settling conflicts cooperatively through compromise. The UN Charter obliges states to seek peaceful dispute resolution. However, the choice of method remains flexible. Diplomatic and adjudicative techniques have advantages and disadvantages, so states weigh various factors in selecting an approach.

## UN Charter provisions on dispute settlement 

The UN Charter contains key provisions relating to the peaceful settlement of international disputes. 

Article 2(3) states that all UN member states "shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered." This establishes a general obligation for UN members to resolve their disputes through peaceful means.

Article 37(1) further elaborates on this by requiring that if parties to a dispute are unable to settle it themselves, they shall refer the dispute to the UN Security Council. The Security Council may then recommend appropriate procedures or methods of adjustment to resolve the dispute.

The 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States elaborates on Article 2(3). It specifies that states shall seek early and just settlement of disputes through negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, or other peaceful means of their choice. 

Overall, these UN Charter provisions create a framework requiring states to pursue peaceful dispute settlement through diplomatic negotiation or third party settlement procedures. The emphasis is on protecting international peace and security while resolving conflicts justly.

## Diplomatic methods of dispute settlement

Diplomatic methods of dispute settlement refer to techniques and procedures that states can use to resolve disputes through peaceful means without resorting to binding third-party adjudication. These methods are based on negotiation and dialogue between the parties rather than formal legal procedures. 

### Negotiation

Negotiation involves direct discussion and bargaining between the disputing parties to reach a mutually acceptable settlement of their differences. This is the most basic technique of dispute settlement. Negotiation provides flexibility for states to reach creative solutions tailored to their unique situation. However, the success of negotiations depends on the good faith of both parties.

### Good offices and mediation 

Good offices and mediation involve the assistance of a third party to facilitate discussions and negotiations between the disputing states. The third party has no authority to impose a settlement but uses their influence to encourage a resolution. Good offices is limited to facilitating communication, while a mediator can actively propose solutions and engage in shuttle diplomacy between the parties. This can help overcome obstacles in direct negotiations.

### Inquiry

An inquiry involves an investigation of the facts and origins of a dispute by an impartial body agreed to by the parties. The inquiry presents its findings in a report, which can form the basis for a settlement between the states by clarifying misunderstandings. Inquiries are useful for bringing an objective perspective when the facts are contested.

### Conciliation

In conciliation, the parties refer their dispute to a conciliation commission consisting of conciliators often appointed by the parties. The commission investigates the dispute and proposes terms of settlement. The report is non-binding, but provides recommendations that may persuade the parties to reach agreement. Conciliation adds a layer of impartial expertise and evaluation to facilitate compromise.

## Negotiation 

Negotiation is perhaps the most common technique for resolving disputes between states. It simply involves diplomatic discussions and bargaining directly between the parties to the dispute, without third party assistance. The parties themselves control the process, procedures and outcome.

Negotiation aims to reach a mutually acceptable compromise or agreement between the disputing states. It requires a genuine willingness from both sides to resolve the issue through flexible discussion and concessions where necessary. 

Negotiation can be informal discussions between government representatives, or more structured conferences and summits. Talks often begin at lower diplomatic levels before elevating to foreign ministers or heads of state if required.

Some examples of international disputes settled primarily through direct negotiation include:

- The Beagle Channel dispute between Chile and Argentina in the 1970s. After failed arbitration, they reached a papal-mediated agreement on border demarcation and maritime rights.

- India and Bangladesh's resolution of boundary disputes in 2015 involving territorial exchanges and demarcation.

- Recent negotiations between Greece and North Macedonia resolving their decades-long dispute over the Macedonian name and identity issues.

When successful, negotiation can be a relatively quick and inexpensive way to achieve dispute settlement compared to litigation or arbitration. However, it relies heavily on political will of both parties to compromise and lacks formal enforcement mechanisms. Negotiation often works best for lower-level or peripheral disputes rather than core security conflicts.

## Good offices and mediation 

Good offices and mediation are informal techniques of conflict resolution that involve a third party providing assistance to the disputing parties to facilitate a resolution. The third party, often an individual state or an international organization, serves as an intermediary to promote dialogue, understanding, and compromise between the parties.

The function of good offices is limited to transmitting messages, fostering direct talks, and engaging in informal discussions to bring the parties together. The third party does not actively participate in the substantive negotiations or propose solutions. Some examples of good offices include the Pope's intermediation between Argentina and Chile in the Beagle Channel dispute, and the efforts by Tanzania and Zambia to foster talks between Ian Smith's white minority government and black nationalist leaders in Rhodesia during the 1970s.

Mediation involves more active participation by the third party through concrete proposals for settlement, procedural suggestions, and substantive compromises. However, the mediator has no binding powers over the parties. Notable examples of successful mediation include the Papal mediation of the border dispute between Argentina and Chile in the late 1970s, US mediation of the Egypt-Israel conflict leading to the 1978 Camp David Accords, and Norwegian mediation of the 1993 peace agreements between Israel and the PLO.

## Inquiry

Inquiry is a method of dispute settlement where the parties agree to establish a commission of inquiry or a fact-finding mission to investigate the facts surrounding a dispute. The inquiry does not make a binding decision but aims to determine the objective facts to help the parties resolve the dispute themselves. 

Some examples of inquiry in international dispute settlement include:

- The Dogger Bank Inquiry in 1904-1905 between Great Britain and Russia after Russian naval forces mistakenly attacked British fishing boats in the North Sea. An international commission of inquiry determined Russia was liable.
- The Red Crusader Commission of Inquiry in 1961 between Denmark and the United Kingdom over the sinking of a Danish fishing vessel by a British warship. The commission determined the British warship was at fault. 
- The 2010 Fact Finding Mission on the Flotilla Incident commissioned by the UN Secretary-General to investigate the Gaza flotilla raid by Israeli forces. The commission found Israel's blockade of Gaza was legal but its use of force excessive.
- Several commissions of inquiry established by the UN Human Rights Council to investigate alleged human rights abuses, such as in Libya in 2011 and in North Korea in 2013.

Inquiry allows neutral investigation of disputed facts and attribution of responsibility without seeking to impose binding decisions on the parties involved. It aims to depoliticize fact-finding to promote dispute resolution.

## Conciliation

Conciliation is a method of dispute settlement whereby a commission is established by the parties in conflict to investigate the dispute and propose solutions, without having any binding authority. The parties are free to accept or reject the proposals made by the conciliation commission.  

Some examples of conciliation commissions include:

- The Dogger Bank incident conciliation commission established in 1904 between Britain and Russia after Russian naval forces mistakenly attacked British fishing boats in the North Sea. The commission helped resolve the dispute diplomatically.
- The conciliation commission established in the 1960s between Malaysia and Indonesia to help resolve their conflict over Borneo territories. Though the final settlement was achieved through other means, the commission helped ease tensions.
- The conciliation commission formed in 1978 between Chile and Argentina as part of the mediation process led by the Vatican. It helped the countries negotiate a peaceful resolution regarding their Beagle Channel border dispute.
- In 1984, a conciliation commission was created between Iraq and Iran to address remaining issues after their war ended. The commission helped facilitate an agreement on prisoners of war.
- A commission was established in 1986 to conciliate between France and New Zealand after the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior ship. It proposed arbitration which the countries accepted to resolve the dispute.

So in summary, conciliation relies on an impartial investigative body to recommend solutions to conflicting parties, but has no power to impose binding decisions. When accepted voluntarily, it can help de-escalate and resolve disputes through compromise and diplomacy.

## Institutional Methods 

Regional organizations play an important role in dispute settlement between member states. Under Article 52(1) of Chapter VIII of the UN Charter, the UN encourages regional organizations to try to peacefully settle local disputes before they are referred to the UN Security Council. This allows regional politics and cultural understanding to be brought to bear, and reduces the burden on the UN system.

There are several key regional organizations that have dispute resolution mechanisms:

- **The African Union** - The AU has established the African Court of Justice and Human Rights to rule on disputes. There is also a Peace and Security Council that can intervene in conflicts. The AU has helped resolve disputes between members like Kenya and Somalia over border demarcation.
- **The Organization of American States** - The OAS was founded in 1948 and has an Inter-American Commission on Human Rights that investigates disputes. There is also an Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The OAS has mediated disputes over borders and trade agreements between North and South American states.
- **The Arab League** - Formed in 1945, the Arab League has mediated disputes between members including the recent rift between several Gulf states. It has also attempted to broker peace agreements between Israel and Arab states. 
- **Europe** - The European Union has its own Court of Justice to settle legal disputes between members. NATO has also helped mediate tensions between members like Turkey and Greece. Other organizations like the OSCE play an important conflict resolution role.

So by empowering regional bodies that understand local context, many disputes can be resolved more quickly and effectively before rising to the level of global conflict. The UN system is critical, but regional organizations are an indispensable first layer for dispute settlement.

## Regional Organizations

Regional organizations play an important role in dispute settlement between member states. Some key examples include:

### The African Union

The African Union (AU) was founded in 2002 and all 55 countries on the African continent are members. Its Constitutive Act provides for a range of dispute resolution mechanisms including mediation, conciliation and arbitration. The AU has intervened to help resolve conflicts in countries like Burundi, Comoros and Sudan.

### The Organisation of American States 

The Organisation of American States (OAS) dates back to the 19th century and has 35 member states across North, Central and South America. The OAS Charter commits members to resolving disputes peacefully and the organization has mediated territorial disputes like the Belize-Guatemala dispute. The OAS also hears disputes at the American Court of Human Rights.

### The Arab League

The Arab League is a 22-member regional organization in the Middle East and North Africa founded in 1945. It has mediated disputes between members, including attempts to resolve the Syrian crisis. There is also a separate judicial body, the Arab Court of Justice, which can adjudicate disputes.

### Europe

In Europe, organizations like the European Union (EU), the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) all play roles in dispute settlement between member states. The EU in particular has strong legally binding dispute resolution mechanisms, including the ability to refer cases to the European Court of Justice.

## Conclusion

Dispute settlement techniques aim to resolve conflicts between states through peaceful means. The UN Charter emphasizes diplomatic solutions, while also providing for adjudication if needed. 

Key diplomatic methods include negotiation, good offices, mediation, inquiry, and conciliation. These techniques rely on discussion and compromise between parties to find agreeable solutions. Regional organizations also facilitate dispute settlements within their spheres of influence.  

When diplomatic efforts fail, states may pursue institutional adjudication through the International Court of Justice or other arbitration. However, peaceful settlement remains the priority. By managing conflicts through legal frameworks, states uphold international law and cooperation.

Dispute settlement protects state sovereignty while avoiding the human costs of unrestrained conflicts. Despite competing interests, shared principles of peace and justice allow states to settle differences through compromise. With creativity and good faith, the international community can develop techniques to resolve even intractable disputes.
