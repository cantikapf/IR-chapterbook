## What are International Organizations (IO)?

International organizations (IO) refer to formal organizations with members from three or more countries that pursue a set of shared goals. The most commonly used definition of IO in academic and practical discussions refers specifically to intergovernmental organizations (IGOs). IGOs are organizations made up of member states represented by their governments. 

Inclusive IGOs are organizations that all parties can join if they meet the membership criteria, while exclusive IGOs are designed to deliberately exclude specific countries from joining. For example, NATO is considered an exclusive IGO since its membership is limited to Western-aligned countries. Regardless of the number of members, budget size, or institutional design, IGOs are the main focus when discussing international organizations.

Regional organizations like the African Union and broad global institutions like the United Nations are both considered IGOs and the primary focus of analysis for international relations scholars. While non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that work across borders are sometimes referred to as international organizations as well, they are more precisely called international non-governmental organizations (INGOs). The membership of INGOs consists of individuals, private groups, and associations rather than states.

## What are Intergovernmental Organizations (IGOs)?

Intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) are formal organizations whose members are sovereign states, represented by their governments. IGOs are created through formal agreements between states. Unlike other international organizations, IGOs possess a permanent bureaucracy and headquarters. 

Some of the defining features of IGOs are:

- Membership consists of sovereign states represented by their governments. Non-state actors like NGOs are generally not allowed to be members.

- They are formed through treaties and agreements between states. Their formation requires state consent and participation in treaty drafting.

- They possess an organizational structure and permanent secretariat. IGOs have an administrative apparatus and bureaucratic processes.

- Headquarters and offices around the world. IGOs have physical offices and a centralized base of operations.

- Voting procedures for member states. IGO governance includes formal voting mechanisms.

- Legal immunity for the organization. IGOs have certain legal protections as international entities.

- Financed through member state contributions. IGO budgets come from member state funding.

Some examples of major IGOs include the United Nations, World Trade Organization, NATO, and the European Union. IGOs facilitate cooperation between states in areas like security, trade, health, and development. They provide an institutional framework for multilateral diplomacy and policymaking.

## What are International Nongovernmental Organizations (INGOs)?

International nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) have individuals, groups, or associations as members rather than states. INGOs are distinct from intergovernmental organizations in that they are not comprised of member state governments. Some examples of major INGOs include Amnesty International, Doctors Without Borders, and Greenpeace. 

INGOs play important roles in global governance by monitoring state actions, providing services, advocating policies, and fostering transnational civil society networks. They derive authority from their missions and perceived impartiality rather than state sovereignty. INGOs have often pioneered issues like human rights, environmental protection, and development that were later taken up by intergovernmental institutions.

However, INGOs have also faced critiques about democratic accountability, bias, imperialism, and crowding out domestic civil society in developing nations. Their authority and legitimacy ultimately depend on voluntary participation and moral persuasion rather than legal status. As non-state actors, INGOs have a complex relationship with international organizations and nation-states.

## What are International Institutions?

International institutions are broader than just international organizations. International institutions are defined as "sets of rules and practices that prescribe behavioral roles, constrain activity, and shape expectations" (Gutner). 

International institutions include both the rules that govern world politics, such as international law and norms, as well as the organizations that help implement those rules. For example, the Bretton Woods system that governed the international monetary order after World War 2 was an important international institution that included rules about exchange rates as well as organizations like the IMF and World Bank.

The key distinction is that international organizations are tangible entities with headquarters, staff, budgets, etc. International institutions encompass those formal organizations but also include the underlying rules, norms, and procedures that shape how states interact in the issue area. So international institutions = international regimes + international organizations (the rules + the organizations).

## What are International Regimes?

International regimes are sets of implicit or explicit norms, rules, and decision-making procedures around which actors' expectations converge in a given area of international relations. International regimes regulate behavior and constrain activity in international affairs. 

International regimes cover issue areas such as trade, the environment, security, and human rights. They are composed of principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures that shape actors' expectations and behavior. For example, the global trade regime under the WTO consists of principles like non-discrimination, norms of open markets, rules governing trade disputes, and procedures for negotiation rounds.

The concept of international regimes is often used interchangeably with international institutions, although some scholars delineate between the two. International regimes refer specifically to the rules and procedures in an issue area, while institutions also encompass the organizations that implement the rules. But in common usage, "international institution" and "international regime" largely overlap in meaning.

International regimes emerge through tacit consent and coordination between states. They reflect shared norms and practices, even if not codified in treaties. Regimes create order and stable expectations in international relations, allowing states to cooperate on issues such as economics, environment, and security.

## What is Multilateralism?

Multilateralism refers to the practice of coordinating national policies between groups of three or more states. It focuses on following principles like nondiscrimination when coordinating relations between multiple countries. 

Multilateralism is criticized as being too quantitative and formal, focusing only on the number of parties involved rather than the quality of the relationships. The qualitative, substantive view focuses more on the nature of the relations between states rather than just the quantity.

In trade agreements, multilateralism follows the principle of nondiscrimination. In security agreements, multilateralism aligns with collective security frameworks. 

Multilateralism is an adjective that modifies the noun "institution." It represents an institutional form that coordinates relations between three or more states based on generalized principles of conduct. These principles specify appropriate behavior for classes of actions, regardless of the specific interests of individual parties.

The core principles of multilateralism aim to promote coordination and cooperation between multiple states by following certain guidelines and norms of behavior. Multilateralism provides the foundation for many international institutions and organizations.

## What is Global Governance?

Global governance refers to the broad range of rules, norms, principles, practices, and decision-making procedures that help manage issues in the international arena. It involves both state and non-state actors working together to address global challenges. 

Unlike formal intergovernmental organizations, global governance tends to be more informal, decentralized, and inclusive. It operates across many different policy domains and issue areas beyond just security and economics. Global governance can be both regulative with explicit rules and enforcement mechanisms, as well as constitutive by shaping identities and setting social norms.

Some examples of global governance in action are the coordination around climate change mitigation, setting international standards on labor rights, or establishing frameworks for global health security. While states still play a dominant role, global governance recognizes the increasing importance of non-state actors like NGOs, corporations, and transnational advocacy networks in the international order. It represents a move towards a more complex, multi-level system of managing global issues.

## Roles of International Organizations

International organizations serve a number of important roles for member states. First, they provide a regular forum where member states can meet and discuss issues of mutual concern. The routine gatherings of IOs give members a space to develop shared understandings and find areas of agreement. 

Second, IOs help states coordinate their actions. By pooling financial, technological, and analytical resources, states can work together effectively to accomplish goals that no single state could achieve alone. IOs provide the platform for this collaboration.

A third major function of IOs is drafting international law. Organizations like the United Nations have codified many important treaties and legal frameworks that regulate state behavior. Without IOs, building consensus around binding international law would be much more difficult.  

In addition, IOs can provide strategic value for their members. States might see membership as a way to pursue certain policy objectives more effectively. For example, smaller states can amplify their influence by operating through an IO.

IOs also allow leading states to lock in their preferred order. After major wars, victorious powers have created organizations to enshrine the post-war arrangements they favor. Joining an IO signals a state's support for the goals and rules of that institution.

Member states can also use IOs to provide justification for unpopular domestic policies. They can claim their hands are tied by IO commitments. 

Finally, some IOs like the International Court of Justice adjudicate disputes between member states. Their rulings help peacefully resolve conflicts in accordance with international law.

## Case Studies of Major International Organizations

### United Nations (UN)

The United Nations is arguably the most prominent international organization in the world. Established in 1945 after World War II, the UN's main objectives include maintaining international peace and security, protecting human rights, delivering humanitarian aid, promoting sustainable development, and upholding international law. 

The UN has 193 member states and is headquartered in New York City. The main organs of the UN include the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Secretariat, and the International Court of Justice. Some notable UN programs and subsidiary organizations include UNICEF, UNESCO, UNDP, UNHCR, WHO, and UNEP.

Over the decades, the UN has had many important achievements, such as overseeing decolonization, authorizing military action in Korea and Kuwait, deploying peacekeeping missions, facilitating historic arms reduction treaties, and setting the Millennium Development Goals. However, the UN has also faced criticism for bureaucracy, ineffectiveness, and scandals. Reform of the Security Council remains a divisive issue.

### North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an intergovernmental military alliance between 28 North American and European countries. NATO was established in 1949 in response to the threat posed by the Soviet Union. 

NATO's headquarters are in Brussels, Belgium. The fundamental role of NATO is to safeguard the freedom and security of its member countries by political and military means. A key principle of the alliance is collective defense, meaning an attack on one member is considered an attack on all.

Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has expanded its membership and operations. NATO forces have been deployed on peacekeeping and counter-piracy missions. However, the alliance faces challenges such as balancing the interests of member states, budget constraints, and differing perspectives on Russia.

### World Trade Organization (WTO)

The World Trade Organization is an international organization that regulates trade between nations. The WTO officially commenced operations in 1995 and has 164 member countries. The WTO is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.

The WTO provides a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and resolving disputes between members. A core function is ensuring that trade flows as smoothly, freely and predictably as possible. The WTO agreements cover topics such as agriculture, services, intellectual property, dumping practices, and food sanitation regulations. 

The WTO has been credited with substantially reducing trade barriers and expanding world trade. However, it remains a controversial organization. Common criticisms include a lack of transparency, allegations of unfair policies favoring rich countries, and environmental impacts. The WTO faces challenges posed by globalization, rise of bilateral trade deals, and growth of China.

## Criticisms of International Organizations

International organizations are not without their critics. Here are some of the major criticisms leveled against them:

### Lack of Enforcement Powers

One major criticism of international organizations is their lack of enforcement powers. Unlike national governments which have police and military forces to enforce laws and policies, international organizations have very limited powers of enforcement. They typically rely on member states to voluntarily comply with the organization's rules and decisions. However, states often ignore rules that go against their interests. Without enforcement powers, international organizations struggle to compel compliance.

### Bureaucracy/Inefficiency 

Critics argue that international organizations suffer from large, unwieldy bureaucracies that are slow to act and adapt. With so many member states involved, reaching consensus is difficult and decisions are often watered down to the "lowest common denominator" acceptable to all. Critics contend this results in organizations setting vague, meaningless goals or implementing inefficient solutions. Supporters counter that bureaucratic inefficiency is the price of getting all parties to agree to collective action.

### Dominated by Powerful States

International organizations are often criticized as being dominated by the most powerful member states. The UN Security Council, for example, is dominated by its five permanent members. Powerful states can bypass organizations when their interests are at stake or block actions that go against their interests. This undermines the legitimacy of the organization in the eyes of smaller states. However, defenders note that without support from major powers, international organizations would be irrelevant.

### Infringement on Sovereignty 

Critics argue that international organizations infringe upon the sovereignty of member states. Binding rules and decisions made by international bodies undermine the authority of national governments. Some fear international organizations will become unaccountable "world governments" that impose solutions. Supporters counter that states voluntarily join organizations and can withdraw. Pooling sovereignty is necessary to tackle global issues no state can solve alone.
