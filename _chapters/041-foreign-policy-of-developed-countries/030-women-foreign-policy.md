## Introduction 

Foreign policy decision-making has historically been male-dominated. Institutions and processes involved in formulating foreign policy have traditionally excluded women or minimized their influence. This male dominance stems from societal norms and beliefs that men are more suited to leadership roles, especially in areas involving security, defense and international relations. 

However, throughout history, some powerful women have found ways to shape the foreign policy of their nations. Examples include Cleopatra in ancient Egypt, Queen Elizabeth I in 16th century England, and Catherine the Great in 18th century Russia. In modern times, women like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the UK, Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland in Norway, and U.S. Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Hillary Clinton have played major roles in foreign policy. 

So while foreign policy decision-making remains disproportionately male, women have always looked for opportunities to exert influence through formal and informal means. Their impact reminds us that foreign policy ultimately reflects a diversity of perspectives, including both men and women.

## Societal Factors Influencing Women in Foreign Policy

Societal beliefs and norms have shaped the role of women in foreign policy over time. Traditional patriarchal views about gender roles position men as acceptable for dominant positions in society and institutions, while women face assumptions of inferiority. 

Historically, social constructs based around patriarchy became entrenched in many cultures. Men were seen as suited for leadership, authority and decision-making positions. Women, in contrast, were often relegated to domestic roles or excluded from public life. 

Under patriarchal systems, the idea that men should control politics, institutions and the public sphere became an accepted societal norm. This led to women being systematically denied positions of leadership and power throughout history, including in foreign policy.

Patriarchal values embedded in society meant women faced barriers to entering foreign policy. They were seen as unsuited or incapable when it came to formulating policy, diplomacy or representing the state. 

These ingrained societal beliefs about gender roles excluded women from foreign policy institutions and decision-making. The assumption was that women did not belong in a realm viewed as men's domain.

Overall, patriarchal views of male and female roles within society have significantly influenced women's participation in foreign policy historically. Deeply entrenched ideas of male dominance and superiority kept women out of foreign policy positions and marginalized their voices. Challenging these societal beliefs has been crucial in enabling more women to play meaningful roles in international relations and policy.

## Organizational Factors

Organizational factors within institutions and governments also influence the role of women in foreign policy. A key issue is the extent to which institutions are structured to support women in the workplace. The division of labor and opportunity for advancement within organizations shapes the prospects for women to obtain important leadership and decision-making positions.

For example, foreign policy institutions have traditionally been male-dominated, with norms and cultures that favored men for senior roles and leadership positions. This created barriers for women seeking to rise through the ranks into positions of influence over foreign policy decisions. Discrimination, glass ceilings, lack of work-life balance policies, and boys club cultures made it difficult for women to succeed.  

However, as institutions evolve to promote greater diversity and inclusion, the organizational barriers facing women can be reduced. Policies providing flexible work arrangements, paid family leave, affordable childcare, and mentorship help create an environment where women can thrive professionally. Improving recruitment, hiring, and promotion practices also enables more women to attain leadership roles where they can shape foreign policy priorities and strategies.

The organizational composition and labor structure of foreign policy institutions have a major impact on opening pathways for women to reach the highest levels of decision-making power. As these institutional factors change to be more inclusive, the role of women in formulating foreign policy expands.

## Individual Factors

A woman's individual background and experiences shape her path in foreign policy. Key individual factors include:

- Family and Upbringing. A woman's family background and upbringing influences her access to education, experiences, and career opportunities. Women from privileged backgrounds may have more resources and encouragement to pursue foreign policy, while women lacking family support may face more obstacles.  
- Education Level. Higher levels of education increase women's prospects in foreign policy. Educated women develop relevant knowledge and skills for analysis, negotiation, and leadership. They also gain credentials signaling competence. 
- Professional Experiences. Work experiences in law, academia, journalism, activism, and government expand women's expertise and connections. International experiences aid understanding of foreign contexts. Even unrelated jobs teach transferable skills.
- Personal Interests and Motivations. Women motivated by global affairs, cultural exchange, or social impact tend to seek foreign policy roles. Those valuing work-life balance may hesitate to take demanding positions requiring frequent travel. 
- Mentors and Sponsors. Influential individuals providing guidance, advocacy, and opportunities help women navigate institutional barriers. Access to networks of support increases women's advancement.
- Self-Confidence. Women's assertiveness, willingness to take risks, and belief in themselves shape their ambition. Lack of confidence due to cultural norms or discrimination may inhibit women from pursuing leadership.

Overall, women's personal backgrounds equip them differently for foreign policy. Tapping diverse experiences and perspectives strengthens policymaking. Reducing structural barriers allows more women to contribute their talents.

## Influence of Women in Foreign Policy 

Women have been pushing to gain more influence in foreign policy. Their increasing involvement has had several notable effects:

- **Closing the Gender Gap** - As more women take on leadership roles in foreign policy, they help close the gender gap that has long excluded women from decision-making positions. Women bring new perspectives and priorities to the table. Their presence and voices lead to more gender sensitive policies.
- **Overcoming Stereotypes and Beliefs** - Women in foreign policy must confront stereotypes that they are unqualified, overly emotional, or ill-suited for the job. But as more women excel in senior positions, they prove these stereotypes wrong and earn respect. Their successes pave the way for future women leaders.
- **Different Attitudes and Management Styles** - Women often bring different attitudes and leadership styles that can positively impact foreign policy. Research shows that women leaders tend to be more collaborative and democratic. They utilize soft power tools more. Women also seem more inclined to use negotiation over aggression. Their involvement provides balance in decision-making.

So while challenges remain, the growing influence of women in foreign policy is making the field more inclusive and sensitive to women's perspectives. Their input is reshaping priorities, attitudes and approaches.

## The Structure of FPDM Mechanism and The Problem of the Representation of Women

The decision-making process in foreign policy is conducted by specific institutions or persons in every country, considering both the external environment and internal environment. Several factors affect the formation of that country’s foreign policy, such as the subject of culture (values, traditions, opinions, and symbols); and the identity of decision-makers (ethnic, religious, political, etc.). 

People assume different roles in the society according to their gender identity. In the foreign policy arena, gender stereotypical judgments are most apparent, because it refers to a country’s preferences towards an international system based on its goals or calculation - which is dominated by masculine values.

The decision-making processes often exclude women's perspectives, as factors like culture, identity, and gender roles lead to masculine values dominating.

## Swedish Feminist Foreign Policy

Since October 2014, Sweden became the first country that applied feminist foreign policy. The feminist foreign policy applied the gender equality perspectives in response to any foreign policy issues in international politics.  

The core of Feminist Foreign Policy focused on 4R’s, such as women and girls’ rights, Representation and Resources, and also Reality. This core as an essential strategy to improve women and girl condition from discrimination and gender inequality in a whole aspect of life.

As part of the strategy of Sweden Government to pursue gender equality, there are international framework applied to strengthen their commitment, such as The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, CEDAW, UNSC RESOLUTION 1325, EU Action Plan for Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in EU (2016-2020)

## International Frameworks for Gender Equality in Foreign Policy

Gender equality in foreign policy is supported by several international frameworks and agreements. These provide guidelines and commitments that countries can adopt to strengthen women's rights and participation globally. 

### Universal Declaration of Human Rights

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the United Nations in 1948. It sets out fundamental human rights to be protected universally, including the right to equality for women and men in all spheres of life. The UDHR has inspired numerous legally binding international human rights treaties.

### Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women  

The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is an international treaty adopted in 1979 that defines discrimination against women and sets obligations to end it. 187 countries have ratified CEDAW. It mandates equal rights for women in areas including education, employment, healthcare, and family law. CEDAW has been instrumental in advancing women's rights policies worldwide.

### UN Security Council Resolution 1325

UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security was adopted in 2000. It recognizes the disproportionate impact of conflict on women and girls. It calls for women's equal participation and full involvement in peacebuilding, conflict resolution, and post-conflict reconstruction. Resolution 1325 has put gender equality issues on the agenda of the UN Security Council.

### EU Gender Equality Action Plan 

The European Union (EU) adopted the Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment: Transforming the Lives of Girls and Women through EU External Relations 2016-2020. This action plan aims to accelerate progress towards meeting international commitments on gender equality and women’s empowerment. It provides objectives and indicators to promote gender equality through the EU's external policies.

## Challenges Remaining

Despite some progress, women remain underrepresented in foreign policy globally. Many foreign ministries and diplomatic institutions are still predominantly male. There is often resistance and backlash to explicitly feminist foreign policies. Even when policies exist, translating them into meaningful change within organizations' cultures remains an ongoing struggle.  

Some key challenges that remain include:

- **Continued underrepresentation of women globally:** Women make up less than 30% of diplomats worldwide and only about 20% of ambassadors. Leadership positions are even more heavily skewed toward men. There is a persistent lack of gender parity.
- **Resistance to feminist foreign policies:** Initiatives like Sweden's feminist foreign policy have faced criticism and resistance. Some view women's empowerment as in conflict with traditional values or national interests. Others see it as Western cultural imperialism. Overcoming this resistance requires education and demonstrating benefits.
- **Need for cultural shift within institutions:** Even when policies and quotas exist on paper, actually changing the male-dominated cultures of foreign policy institutions has proven difficult. There needs to be improvement in workplace practices, attitudes, and behaviors to achieve true gender equality in diplomatic spaces.

So while the rhetoric and intentions toward greater gender equality in foreign policy have grown, significant challenges remain in translating this into reality. Greater representation, shifting cultures and attitudes, and overcoming resistance will be key priorities going forward.
