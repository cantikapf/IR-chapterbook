Social science is the collective body of knowledge that explores the nature, growth, and functioning of human society. Unlike the natural sciences that focus on phenomena such as stem cells and light waves, social science delves into the intricate workings of society itself, utilizing social and behavioral explanations to comprehend the complex tapestry of human interactions.

### **The Scope of Social Sciences**

Social scientists employ empirical research methods to investigate interpersonal and intrapersonal behaviors, ranging from the dynamics of falling in love to the motivations behind criminal activities. Empirical research, as a cornerstone of international relations, draws knowledge from observed and measured phenomena, providing insights derived from actual experiences rather than theoretical speculation.

### **The Focus of Social Sciences**

The study of social science involves a nuanced exploration of human relationships, the reinterpretation of past events, and the interplay of cultural, biological, and physical elements. Examining basic social systems, institutions, and processes, social scientists scrutinize relationships between individuals and institutions, as well as the intricate connections among political, economic, and social entities.

### **The Origins of Social Science**

As the 19th century dawned, social science secured a firm and respectable position across leading European countries. Figures like Auguste Comte influenced subsequent luminaries such as Emile Durkheim and Karl Marx. Despite its historical roots, social science is a relatively young science, with ongoing debates about its limits and boundaries, as noted by Lawrence A. Kempton in "Social Sciences Today."

### **Scientific Methods and Applications**

Scientific inquiry in social science requires a society with developed or tolerated attitudes conducive to research. Grounded in the assumption of an orderly universe governed by cause and effect, the scientific method explores the conditions favorable to scientific inquiry and delves into the experimental method, acknowledging its inherent limitations.

### **Research Stages in Social Sciences**

Social science research follows a systematic approach with stages such as observation, problem definition, literature review, theoretical framework development, hypothesis formulation, research design selection, data collection, results analysis, and conclusion drawing. This structured process ensures a rigorous and evidence-based exploration of social phenomena.

### **Approaches and Methods in Social Science Research**

Social scientists adopt various approaches, such as functionalist, exchange theory, conflict theory, and symbolic interaction theory, each offering a unique perspective on research projects. Accompanying these approaches are methods like the historical method, case method, and comparative and cross-cultural methods, providing diverse tools to investigate and analyze social phenomena.

### **Social Science and Society**

Contrary to concerns about societal objectives, social scientists aim to discover how objectives can be achieved. Their role is to facilitate understanding, addressing issues, outlining difficulties, and proposing steps toward viable solutions.

### **Three Major Perspectives of Sociology**

Within sociology, three major perspectives guide the analysis of societal structures. Functionalism views society as a complex system of interacting parts with shared values, norms, and gradual change. Conflict theory perceives society as a struggle for resources and power, emphasizing inevitable and often beneficial change. Symbolic interactionism studies society through individual and small group interactions, exploring the shared symbols and nonverbal communications that shape human experiences and the construction of identity.

In conclusion, the realm of social science offers a multifaceted lens through which we can comprehend the intricacies of human society, bridging the gap between historical roots and contemporary challenges.
