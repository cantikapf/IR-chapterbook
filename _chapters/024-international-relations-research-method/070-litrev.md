## Scholarly Literature and the Literature Review

### Scholarly Literature

Scholarly literature refers to research that is published in academic journals and books by experts in a particular field. It is different from more popular sources like newspapers, magazines, websites, and encyclopedias in several key ways:

- **Purpose**: Scholarly literature aims to present new research, theories, methodologies, interpretations, or arguments to advance knowledge in a field. Popular sources provide general information for a broad audience.
- **Authors**: Scholarly literature is written by scholars and researchers who are actively contributing new knowledge in their field. Popular sources may incorporate scholarly findings, but are not written by the original researchers.
- **Audience**: Scholarly literature is aimed at other experts in the field. The writing assumes the reader has background knowledge and uses field-specific terminology. Popular sources target the general public.
- **Editorial process**: Scholarly publications undergo extensive peer-review before being accepted for publication. This review verifies the validity, originality, and importance of the research. Popular sources do not have a comparable peer-review process.
- **References**: Scholarly works always cite their sources and influences. References allow the reader to trace the evidence that leads to the author's conclusions. Popular sources may include occasional references.
- **Systematic methodology**: Scholarly research follows well-defined protocols and rigorous methodologies designed to add reliable new findings to the knowledge base of the field. Popular writing does not produce new knowledge in this way.

The major types of scholarly literature include:

- **Journal articles**: Report on original research and experiments. The most prestigious journals rigorously peer-review submissions to uphold standards.
- **Scholarly books**: In-depth studies on a topic that integrate the latest research findings. Academic presses oversee scholarly book publication.
- **Edited books**: Anthologies of separately authored chapters focused on a theme or issue. Edited by experts who provide commentary.
- **Conference papers**: Preliminary research presented at academic conferences and symposia before being revised for journal or book publication.

Scholarly literature provides the theoretical background and research-based evidence needed to design rigorous studies and advance knowledge in a field. It is a foundational component of quality research across disciplines.

### The Importance of Scholarly Literature

Scholarly literature serves some key functions in the research process. Most importantly, reviewing prior scholarly work helps refine research questions and identify potential variables and hypotheses. The research questions drive the entire research project, so it's critical to harness the knowledge in existing literature to develop thoughtful and focused research questions.

Additionally, the literature review establishes important connections between the proposed research and previous studies in the field. By thoroughly reviewing relevant scholarly work, researchers can show how their study fits into the existing body of knowledge. The literature review provides crucial background context and demonstrates how the new study expands on or departs from what has already been studied. In this way, the literature review helps to position new research studies in relation to prior knowledge.

Overall, a strong review of scholarly literature brings clarity and direction to a research project. It enables researchers to leverage the insights and findings of previous studies to craft novel, relevant research questions that can advance knowledge in the field. The literature review is thus a vital stepping stone in developing impactful research.

### Types of Scholarly Literature

#### Scholarly Journals
Scholarly journals, also known as academic or peer-reviewed journals, are periodicals that publish original research articles written by experts in a specific discipline. The articles are written by scholars for other scholars. These journals go through a rigorous peer-review process, where other experts in the field review the articles before they are accepted for publication. This helps ensure the articles meet the journal's standards for quality research. Examples of scholarly journals in international relations include International Organization, International Studies Quarterly, and Foreign Affairs.

#### Peer-Reviewed Books
Peer-reviewed books are scholarly books whose manuscripts have gone through review by other experts before being accepted for publication. University presses often publish peer-reviewed books. The peer-review process helps ensure the accuracy and quality of the research and writing. Examples of university presses that publish peer-reviewed books in international relations include Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, and Princeton University Press.

#### Edited Books
Edited books contain chapters written by different authors on a central theme. The book editor solicits chapters from experts and coordinates the book's production. Edited books allow examination of a topic from diverse scholarly perspectives. Examples of edited books in international relations include Globalization and the Nation State and Critical Perspectives on the Responsibility to Protect.

#### Electronic Sources
There are some high-quality scholarly electronic sources. These include scholarly articles available through academic databases like JSTOR and academic research repositories like SSRN. However, when evaluating electronic sources it's important to assess their credibility, accuracy, reputation, and currency. High-quality scholarly sources will provide citations and references. Examples of reputable scholarly blogs in international relations include Duck of Minerva and War on the Rocks.

### How to determine whether an online article comes from a scholarly journal

When reviewing online articles and sources, there are several indicators to look for to determine if the source comes from a credible, scholarly publication:

#### Level of Detail
Scholarly sources will provide in-depth details, descriptions, and discussions of the topic at hand. They should demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the subject rather than superficial summations.

#### Technical Language
Scholarly publications utilize discipline-specific terminology and language conventions suited for an academic audience. The writing style and vocabulary will differ from more mainstream publications.

#### Explanation of Methodology
Reputable scholarly articles will describe in detail the research methods, data collection, and analytical processes used by the authors. This allows readers to evaluate the rigor and validity of the study.

#### Citations
Scholarly publications rely heavily on citations to reference existing literature, studies, data sources, and other evidentiary materials. Citations and references will be provided as footnotes, endnotes, or a bibliography.

#### Credible Authors
The authors of scholarly publications will have academic credentials and expertise related to the research topic. Information about their background is typically provided.

#### Peer Review
Scholarly journals utilize a peer review process where submissions are evaluated by expert reviewers to assess methodology, accuracy, and contribution to the field. Articles accepted have passed this rigorous vetting.

## Reviewing the Literature

### The Place of the Literature Review in Research

The literature review provides important background for a research study. It establishes the links between the study being proposed and previous work that has already been done in the area. A good literature review shows how the findings of the study contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the field. It also helps integrate the new research findings into what is already known.

The literature review helps bring clarity and focus to a research problem. By reviewing previous studies, the researcher learns what aspects of the topic have already been examined, what has been found, what gaps exist, and what suggestions have been made for further research. This helps the researcher focus their own study on areas where more information is needed.

Reviewing previous literature also allows the researcher to improve their research method. The literature review reveals procedures, methods, and problems encountered in prior studies. This allows the researcher to select methods most likely to provide valid answers to the research questions.

Additionally, the literature review expands the researcher's knowledge of the field and topic area. It is important to understand what other researchers have already found regarding similar questions and topics. This context helps the researcher see how their own findings fit into the existing knowledge base.

### The Function of Literature Review in Our Own Study
 
- When reviewing the literature we learn what aspects of our subject area have been examined by others, what they have found out about these aspects, what gaps they have identified and what suggestions they have made for further research.
- Help us to focus our study on areas where there are gaps in the existing body of knowledge, thereby enhancing its relevance.
- A literature review tells you if others have used procedures and methods similar to the ones that you are proposing, which procedures and methods have worked well for them and what problems they have faced with them.
- By becoming aware of any problems and pitfalls, you will be better positioned to select a method that is capable of providing valid answers to your research question.
- It is important that you know what other researchers have found in regard to the same or similar questions, what theories have been put forward and what gaps exist in the relevant body of knowledge.
- Another important reason for doing a literature review is that it helps you to understand how the findings of your study fit into the existing body of knowledge

### Literature search and review on your topic

- Literature search and review on your topic
	- What are the key theories, concepts and ideas?
	- What are the epistemological and ontological grounds for the discipline?
	- What are the main questions and problems that have been addressed to date?
	- How is knowledge on the topic structured and organised?
	- What are the origins and definitions of the topic? 
	- What are the political standpoints?
	- What are the major issues and debates about the topic? 
	- What are the key sources?

## How to Review the Literature

### Four Steps Involved in Conducting a Literature Review
 
- Searching for the existing literature in your area of study

The first step is to search for existing literature related to your research area or topic. This involves identifying appropriate databases, journals, reference works, and other potential sources of information. It's important to use effective search strategies, including identifying key search terms, Boolean operators, and relevant subject headings. Cast a wide net initially before narrowing your search criteria.

- Reviewing the selected literature.

Once you've gathered a set of potentially relevant sources, the next step is to review them thoroughly. As you review each source, consider the theories presented, methodologies used, findings reported, limitations noted, and conclusions drawn. Take detailed notes and begin identifying themes and important issues that recur across sources. Look for areas of agreement and disagreement within the existing literature.

- Developing a theoretical framework.

Based on your review of the literature, begin articulating the key theories, models, and conceptual frameworks that have informed research in your topic area. Synthesize this information to create a theoretical framework for your own study, showing how it fits into and builds upon existing knowledge.

- Developing a conceptual framework

Finally, develop a conceptual framework that connects the variables and concepts you'll be examining in your study to the broader theoretical framework. Determine the specific relationships between variables you'll investigate and the indicators you'll use to operationally define and measure those variables. Your conceptual framework provides a roadmap for your empirical research.

### Reviewing the Selected Literature
 
When reviewing the literature, it is important to note whether the knowledge relevant to your theoretical framework has been confirmed beyond doubt. Examine the theories put forward, any criticisms of these theories and their basis, the methodologies adopted in prior research (such as study design, sample size and characteristics, measurement procedures, etc.), and any criticisms of the methodologies.

Evaluate to what extent the findings from existing research can be generalized to other situations. Notice where there are significant differences of opinion among researchers and assess the validity of these differences. Ascertain the areas in which little or nothing is known – the gaps that exist in the current body of knowledge. This will help identify opportunities for your own research to fill in some of these gaps.

### Developing a Theoretical Framework

Literature pertinent to your study may deal with two types of information:

1. Universal
2. Specific (i.e. local trends or a specific program)

In writing about such information you should start with the general information, gradually narrowing it down to the specific.

Whereas the theoretical framework consists of the theories or issues in which your study is embedded, the conceptual framework describes the aspects you selected from the theoretical framework to become the basis of your enquiry.

The conceptual framework is focused on indicators to measure the research study.

### Major Concerns

When conducting a literature review, there are some key best practices to keep in mind:

#### Using the Right Keywords

- Identify the key terms that describe your research topic, question, and scope. These will be critical for searching databases and catalogs effectively.
- Consider synonyms, alternate spellings, and related concepts. Cast a wide initial net.
- Refine keywords as the search evolves and you determine which terms yield the most relevant results.

#### Narrowing the Search

- Use filters available in search tools and databases to narrow results by date, methodology, peer review status, etc.
- Identify seminal studies and theoretical frameworks most relevant to your question. Then search citations and works that cite those sources.
- As themes and gaps emerge, search for studies that relate specifically to those areas.

#### Using the Library Effectively

- Work with librarians to understand advanced search techniques for databases and tools specific to your field.
- Use interlibrary loan services to access hard-to-find resources.
- Evaluate not just abstracts but full studies to determine relevance and quality.
- Organize sources and notes systematically from the start. Tracking key information will save time later.
