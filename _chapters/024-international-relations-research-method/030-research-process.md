## Phase 1: Deciding What to Research

The first phase of the research process involves deciding what topic or issue you want to study. This phase lays the groundwork for the rest of your research.

The key step in Phase 1 is formulating a research problem. The research problem identifies what you intend to study and is the foundation of your research project. It helps guide all subsequent stages of the research process.

### 1. Formulating a research problem

When formulating a research problem, you need to answer the question - what do I want to research? The research problem should identify the key concepts, issues, relationships or phenomena you intend to investigate.

Some guidelines for formulating an effective research problem:

- Be as specific and clear as possible. A focused, well-defined research problem leads to more effective research.
- Make sure your research problem is researchable given available time, resources, and access to data.Evaluate feasibility.
- Align the research problem with your and your supervisor's knowledge and expertise. This helps ensure you can successfully study this topic.
- Make sure the research problem fills a gap in understanding, knowledge or policy - there should be a purpose.
- Frame the problem as a question or questions to be answered.

## Phase 2: Planning Research Study

Planning a research study is a critical phase that lays the groundwork for conducting the actual research. There are several key steps involved in planning out the study:

### 2. Conceptualizing a research design

The research design provides a framework for collecting and analyzing data to answer the research questions. It specifies the overall approach and methods that will be used, such as qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, experimental, quasi-experimental, correlational, etc. The design outlines the procedures for selecting participants, collecting data, and analyzing results. A well-conceived design ensures the study will effectively address the research problem.

There are several components to conceptualizing an effective research design:

- Identifying the research design type (qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods)
- Determining the study type (descriptive, correlational, experimental, etc)
- Selecting a sampling technique and sample size
- Outlining data collection procedures
- Developing an analysis plan
- Addressing limitations of the design

### 3. Constructing an instrument for data collection

Researchers must decide how they will systematically collect data and then develop the specific instruments to be used. Common data collection methods include surveys/questionnaires, interviews, focus groups, observations, and review of documents and records. Researchers need to determine if they will use existing instruments or develop their own. The instruments should align with the chosen methodology and allow gathering data that can answer the research questions.

Some key points about constructing research instruments:

- The instrument needs to align with the overall research methodology and design. For example, a quantitative study would require a structured questionnaire versus a qualitative study which may use semi-structured interviews.
- The types of information being collected will inform the instrument choice. This includes deciding if the information will be quantitative, qualitative, descriptive, etc.
- Common instruments include questionnaires, interview schedules, observation checklists, and more. These can be researcher-created or standardized/validated instruments.
- Questionnaires and interviews need to be crafted carefully, with easy to understand wording and a logical flow. Questions should gather the data needed to answer the research questions.
- Pilot testing instruments on a small group helps refine and improve them before full implementation. Checking for clarity, length, flow, etc.
- Final instruments should be polished and professional. Clear instructions are provided where needed.
- Enough instruments need to be produced for the entire sample. Reproduction and distribution is planned.

### 4. Selecting a sample

For studies involving surveys or experiments, the researcher must define the target population and determine an appropriate sampling method. Probability sampling provides the best opportunity for results to represent the population. Common probability methods are simple random, systematic, stratified, and cluster sampling. Nonprobability sampling can also be useful for some research goals. The sampling plan outlines the procedures for selecting units from the population to participate in the study.

There are several key factors to consider when selecting a sample:

- Sample size - The sample must be large enough to be statistically significant and allow the researcher to draw meaningful conclusions. Larger sample sizes lead to more accurate results.
- Sampling technique - Researchers can use probability or non-probability sampling. In probability sampling, each member of the population has a known chance of being selected. Common techniques include simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling. Non-probability sampling relies on non-random selection procedures.
- Representativeness - The sample should adequately represent the total population under study across the relevant characteristics, behaviors and traits. This allows findings to be generalized back to the population. Techniques like stratified sampling improve representativeness.
- Accessibility - Researchers must have reasonable access to the sample population. Certain groups may be difficult to access or recruit.
- Feasibility - Factors like cost, time and available resources may limit sample size or techniques. The sample must be feasible within project constraints.

### 5. Writing a research proposal

The proposal explains the purpose and significance of the study, provides background on existing research, and presents the planned design and methods. It gives specifics on how data will be collected, analyzed, and interpreted. The proposal helps communicate the researcher's intentions to stakeholders, guide the investigation, and enable critical feedback. A well-crafted proposal is key for approval to conduct the study.

## Phase 3: Conducting A Research Study

### 6. Collecting data

Once a research design and instruments are ready, the next step is gathering the data. There are various methods for collecting data such as surveys, interviews, observations, and reviewing documents. The researcher needs to follow the sampling and data collection procedures outlined in the research plan. Sufficient data should be gathered to answer the research questions and test hypotheses. Data collection tools should be administered correctly and consistently for reliability. Enough responses need to be obtained for statistical analysis. During data gathering, ethical guidelines regarding confidentiality and informed consent should be followed.

### 7. Processing and displaying data

After collecting the data, it needs to be prepared for analysis. This can involve transcribing interviews, scanning surveys, coding responses, and entering quantitative data into statistical software. The appropriate analytical techniques outlined in the research design should be applied. Quantitative data is analyzed using statistical methods. Qualitative data is examined to identify themes and patterns. The results should be presented clearly using tables, charts, graphs and other visuals. The analysis aims to summarize the key findings, trends and relationships in the data that relate to the research objectives.

### 8. Writing a research report

Finally, the researcher has to communicate the results and conclusions in a research report or paper. This includes summarizing the methodology, reporting statistical analysis, interpreting the findings, stating conclusions, and making recommendations. The results should be presented logically and coherently. Tables and figures can help convey main findings. Limitations of the research methods and potential biases need to be disclosed. The conclusions should tie directly back to the research problem and purpose. Suggestions for practical applications of the research and future studies can be made. The report should have an academic tone and conform to disciplinary writing conventions. Sharing the research findings advances scientific knowledge.
