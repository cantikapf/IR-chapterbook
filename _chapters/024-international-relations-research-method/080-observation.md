## Observation

### What is Observation?

Observation is a systematic method of watching, recording, analyzing and interpreting people's behavior, events, or phenomena in their natural setting. The observer does not interact or intervene in what is being observed, but simply watches without influencing the situation or outcomes.

Key aspects of observation as a scientific research method include:

- Used to collect primary data about behavior and events in natural settings
- Involves looking and listening carefully and systematically
- Recording what is observed through field notes, audio/video, photographs etc.
- Observing actual behavior versus self-reported behavior
- Non-interference from the observer
- Participants may be unaware they are being observed
- Allows studying of individuals and groups
- Can investigate subtle or complex behaviors or interactions
- Useful for exploratory and inductive research
- Provides contextual, descriptive data

The goal of observation research is to generate insights into behaviors, relationships, patterns, and the contexts in which they occur, by watching people and events unfold naturally.

## Why Observe?

- Observation allows the researcher to study people in their 'natural setting' without their behavior being influenced by the presence of a researcher.
- Observational data usually consists of detailed information about particular groups or situations. This kind of data can 'fill out' and provide a deeper, richer, understanding than survey work which tends to produce less detailed information about a larger number of people.
- Some methods only allow for the study of one individual at a time. Observation enables the research to study groups of people together, that is, it allows for the study of interaction between the members of a group.

## Types of Observation

- Participant Observation

Participant observation involves the researcher directly participating in the activities of the group being studied. The researcher becomes an active member in the culture or context being observed in order to gain greater insight and understanding.

- Non-participant Observation

In non-participant observation, the researcher remains separate from the group under study and does not actively participate in their activities. The researcher observes from an outsider's perspective without direct involvement with the participants.

- Direct Observation

In direct observation, the researcher directly watches and records the behaviors and actions of individuals or groups in real-time. This allows for data collection as the events and behaviors unfold, without relying on after-the-fact recollections or perceptions.

- Indirect Observation

Indirect observations are observations in which the researcher uses existing records instead of making first-hand observations. The researcher does not collect data in real-time but relies on past recordings and documentation for the data.

- Controlled Observation

In controlled observation, the researcher manipulates the environment and controls the factors that are allowed to influence the variables under study. This is done so that extraneous or confounding variables can be controlled and not influence the variables under observation.

- Uncontrolled Observation

Uncontrolled observation occurs when the researcher does not manipulate or control the situation that is being observed. The researcher merely observes behavior, events, phenomena, etc. as they naturally occur in real-world settings. There are no controls introduced or manipulation of variables by the researcher.

## Focus Group

### What is a Focus Group?

A focus group is a small group discussion guided by a facilitator. The facilitator asks questions to elicit perspectives from the participants on the topic being studied.

Focus groups typically consist of 6 to 10 participants who share similar characteristics relevant to the topic. The facilitator uses a discussion guide to lead the group through the questions, allowing the conversation to flow naturally.

The main advantage of focus groups is the opportunity to gather in-depth insights through group discussion. Participants can share ideas and perspectives that may not emerge in individual interviews. The group dynamic often sparks new thoughts as participants hear others' comments.

Focus groups serve various research purposes, including:

- Gaining background information or context on a topic
- Generating research hypotheses based on participants' attitudes and beliefs
- Evaluating reactions to an idea, event or proposal
- Interpreting previously obtained quantitative results through qualitative insights

## Why/When Might You Use Them?

- When you want to generate discussion/debate about your research question/ area of research, but you do not think that individual responses will yield the kinds of data you want.
- When you think that individuals may not be able to provide adequate responses on your research question.
- When people may not feel ‘safe’ talking in individual interviews.
- Other reasons are the same as all qualitative methods (lack of research in area, wanting to develop theory,  wanting to develop a quantitative stage of study, etc.)

## Basic Use of Focus Group

- Problem identification
- Planning
- Implementation
- Assessment
