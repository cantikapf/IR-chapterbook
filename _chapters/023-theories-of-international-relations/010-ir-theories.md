The study of international relations (IR) emerged as an academic discipline after World War I as scholars and practitioners sought to understand the conditions that led to the "World War" and how future wars could be prevented. Since then, IR has evolved from its early idealist roots into a diverse field encompassing multiple theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches.

## Ontology, Epistemology and Methodology 

Each theoretical position in IR revolves around assumptions concerning ontology, epistemology, and methodology. Ontology refers to the nature of reality and what constitutes the fundamental building blocks of the social world. Epistemology examines how we can come to know this reality and the possibility of gaining objective knowledge. Methodology involves the techniques used to uncover and analyze information about world politics. 

While positivism, a prevailing philosophy of science, has long dominated IR scholarship, particularly in the United States, its recent discrediting as a scientific practice does not diminish its historical significance in shaping the discipline. Positivism assumes an objective, observable reality exists independently of observers. Knowledge derives from sensory experience of this external reality. The social world functions according to generalizable laws analogous to the natural sciences. Positivism favors quantitative, empirical methods for uncovering causal explanations and predictive laws.

In contrast, post-positivist approaches in IR question the existence of an observer-independent reality. Social phenomena have inherently subjective qualities not governed by immutable laws. Post-positivism emphasizes understanding the contextual meaning of events, using qualitative methods interpretive of subjective human experiences. 

Divergent meta-theoretical assumptions between positivism and post-positivism have fueled pivotal debates within IR on what constitutes scientific study and whether the field qualifies as a science. The different positions in IR carry distinct ontological, epistemological and methodological viewpoints that shape how theorists conceptualize and study global politics.

## Positivism and IR 

Positivism, a prevailing philosophy of science, has long dominated IR scholarship, particularly in the United States. As a school of thought, positivism emphasizes empirical data and scientific methods, holding that authentic knowledge is based on experience of natural phenomena and their properties and relations. Positivism rejects speculation based on spiritual or metaphysical sources and maintains that research should be value-free and objective. 

In IR, positivism influenced efforts to establish the field as an empirical science, favoring quantitative methods and statistical analysis. Positivism shaped theoretical work seeking to identify universal causal explanations and generalizable patterns, aligned with principles of logic and empiricism. This approach enabled IR scholars to construct theoretical models and derive testable hypotheses about state behavior and world politics.

However, positivism's standing as a credible scientific framework has weakened, as critics have highlighted limitations in its core assumptions. Post-positivism maintains that pure objectivity is impossible and that observations remain theory-laden. Social constructionism argues that the social environment influences our perceptions and sense of reality. Interpretivism emphasizes understanding meanings and subjective experiences rather than external causes. 

These critiques have undermined positivism and sparked vigorous debates about appropriate scientific methods in studying global politics. While positivism retains influence, its dominance has diminished. Yet its historical role in shaping IR as an academic discipline remains significant.

## Defining IR as a Science 

Two pivotal meta-theoretical questions have persistently defined IR: what constitutes the scientific study of world politics and the perennial debate over whether IR qualifies as a science. IR scholars have long wrestled with defining the field as a science, sparking significant debates over what constitutes scientific study and rigor when analyzing global politics and relations between states. 

Many have critiqued IR as failing to meet key criteria of a science, lacking theoretical coherence, an agreed upon methodology, or defined boundaries as an academic discipline. The complexity of international relations, with countless variables interacting in dynamic and unpredictable ways, poses challenges for systematic theory building and testing. IR's subject matter - the behavior of states driven by national interests and power - is difficult to measure and quantify precisely. 

However, defenders argue IR utilizes rigorous methods of hypothesis testing, statistical analysis, and modeling rooted in scientific rationalism. The prominence of quantitative approaches and formal modeling reflect IR's scientific aspirations. While lacking the precision of natural sciences, IR develops contingent generalizations and applies scientific logic in studying world politics. The debate continues between those arguing IR cannot attain the standards of a true science versus others believing it has evolved into a mature, replicable discipline. How IR negotiates scientific norms and objectivity versus interpretive methods shapes the field's scope and impact.

## First Great Debate 

The First Great Debate emerged during and after World War I, pitting **idealists against realists**. Idealists advocated for institutions and reason to control human irrationalities that they believed had led to the Great War, while realists critiqued them for focusing on how the world "ought to be" rather than pragmatically addressing objective realities. 

The idealists, led by figures like Woodrow Wilson, supported the establishment of international organizations like the League of Nations to promote cooperation, collective security, and the peaceful resolution of disputes between nations. They believed that binding rules, norms and institutions could overcome selfish national interests and aggression.

In contrast, realists like E.H. Carr rejected these ideas as naive and utopian. They argued that power politics and national self-interest necessarily shape state behavior in an anarchic international system lacking a supreme authority. Rather than imagining an ideal world, realists focused on world politics as it existed, emphasizing power, military capabilities and the balance of power between nation-states. 

This seminal debate helped define the contours of the nascent field of IR, with idealism fading as realist accounts of WWI proved more compelling to make sense of the interwar period. The Great Debate established realism as the dominant paradigm in IR for decades to come.

## Second Great Debate

The Second Great Debate in the 1960s centered on **methodology**, dividing traditionalists defending a humanistic approach from modernizers pushing for greater methodological rigor. This debate emerged from dissatisfaction with the prevalence of descriptive and philosophical approaches lacking systematic methods of analysis. 

The traditionalists believed the study of IR should focus on historically-oriented, qualitative research to capture the complexity of political life. They emphasized the role of subjective human consciousness and moral purpose in global politics. Traditionalists argued for retaining interdisciplinary flexibility rather than narrow methodological constraints.

In contrast, the modernizers pushed for theoretically-driven empirical research drawing on quantitative methods from economics and other social sciences. They advocated for greater methodological rigor to develop generalizable theoretical explanations of world politics. The modernizers wanted the study of IR to emulate the hard sciences and critiqued traditional approaches as interpretive, philosophical, and insufficiently scientific. 

## Third Great Debate (Inter-Paradigm Debate)

The Third Great Debate in the 1970s and 1980s engaged **realist, pluralist (liberal), and globalist (marxist)** positions in understanding and explaining international processes.

The realist position asserted that states were motivated by self-interest and the pursuit of power in an anarchic world where there was no overarching authority to regulate their interactions and they viewed International Relations through a prism of competitive relations. Realists emphasized nation-state sovereignty and saw international institutions and organizations as epiphenomenal or marginal phenomena inasmuch as they did not directly influence state behavior. 

Pluralists challenged realism by suggesting that states were not the only relevant actors in international politics. Pluralists pointed to the existence and growing influence of non-state and transnational actors and their interactions with states. They emphasized examining relationships among these various types of actors to understand global politics. They also acknowledge realist perspective but also advocated the mutual benefits for states through greater cooperative relations.

Globalist critiqued both realists and pluralists for taking the state-centric framework of international politics for granted, and for ignoring capitalism's influence on economic and social structures, as well as conflicts stemming from economic classes. Marxists advocated analyzing global capitalism's impacts on international relations and conflicts between states and other actors.

## Fourth Great Debate

The Fourth Debate, characterizing IR since the mid-1980s, involves deep-seated disagreements on what the discipline should study and how. This debate emerged as positivism's dominance as the primary philosophy of science in IR began to erode. It can be characterized in many ways: as a debate between explaining (scientific) and understanding (interpretive), between positivism (empiricist) and post-positivism and between rationalism and reflectivism.

On one side of the debate are explanatory theorists, who align with positivism and believe IR should seek to identify general causal relationships and laws that can explain international processes and events. These scholars aim to test hypotheses and build empirical models to explain phenomena like interstate wars, alliance formations, or economic agreements.

On the other side are interpretive scholars, who argue that IR should focus more on understanding social life and the internal meanings created by social actors. Interpretivists reject the positivist notion that the social world can be studied like the natural/physical world. They emphasize the importance of subjective beliefs, perceptions, shared meanings, and social constructs. 

While explanatory theorists align with quantitative methods, interpretivists promote qualitative approaches centered on social meanings. This methodological divide underpins the substantive disagreements over what IR should study and how. The Fourth Debate brought these longstanding tensions between positivism and post-positivist alternatives to the fore in IR.

## Conceptions of IR Theory

There are divergent conceptions of what constitutes a theory in international relations scholarship. These include:

- **Explanatory Theories** - Seek to identify general causes and effects, make predictions, and provide explanations. Aligned with positivism. Example theories are realism, liberalism, and Marxism.
- **Critical Theories** - Challenge prevailing theoretical orthodoxies and aim to reveal structures of power and domination. Associated with the Frankfurt School. 
- **Normative Theories** - Make value judgements about ideal models for political order and justice. Prescriptive in nature.
- **Reflectivist/Interpretive Theories** - Emphasize understanding meanings, reasons, and subjective experiences rather than causes and effects. Associated with constructivism and post-structuralism.
- **Constitutive Theories** - Argue identities and interests are constructed through social interaction, rather than given prior to it. 

There are divergent views on issues like objectivity, theory testing, and the relationship between theory and practice. This underscores the importance of considering meta-theoretical issues and assumptions in evaluating IR theories. Different conceptions of theory play crucial roles in shaping the IR discipline.
