## Introduction

South East Asia (SEA) refers to the southern region of Asia, located between the Indian subcontinent to the west and China, Korea, and Japan to the north and east. The region comprises the mainland Southeast Asian countries of Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, as well as the Maritime Southeast Asian nations of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei, Philippines, and Timor-Leste. 

Geographically, SEA stretches from Myanmar in the northwest down through Malaysia and Indonesia, with over 600 million people inhabiting its 4.5 million square kilometers. SEA lies along critical sea lanes and is an important nexus point between the Indian and Pacific oceans. The region is incredibly diverse, with hundreds of ethnic groups and languages spoken across the 11 countries.

## Colonial History

South East Asia has a diverse colonial history, experiencing colonization by several major European powers. Starting in the 16th century, Portugal and Spain established colonies in the region. The Portuguese occupied parts of present-day Indonesia, Malaysia, and East Timor, while the Spanish colonized the Philippines.  

In the 17th-19th centuries, the Netherlands became a dominant colonial power in South East Asia. The Dutch East India Company controlled what is now Indonesia and wrested Malacca from the Portuguese. The Dutch eventually took over the whole Indonesian archipelago, exploiting its valuable spices and resources.

France also staked its claim in South East Asia in the 17th-19th centuries. It progressively colonized parts of modern-day Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos to form French Indochina. The French sought to spread Catholicism and exploit raw materials like coal, zinc, and rubber.

Finally, Britain colonized Singapore, Malaysia, and Myanmar (Burma) in the 18th-19th centuries. It conquered Singapore from the Dutch and gained control of Malaysia through its influence over local sultans. Britain was attracted by the region's strategic location and natural riches like tin and petroleum. 

Overall, South East Asia experienced extensive colonization by major European powers like Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, France, and Britain. This colonial rule would shape the region's political, economic, and social landscape for centuries to come.

## Origin of 'South East Asia' Term 

The term "South East Asia" was formally coined and used in major conferences during World War II. Specifically, the Quebec Conference held in August 1943 led to the establishment of the Southeast Asia Command (SEAC I), which included the geographical region east of India and south of China. The SEAC I included territories like Burma, Malaya, Sumatra, and Thailand. 

The Potsdam Conference in July 1945 expanded the SEAC to SEAC II, incorporating additional territories like the Netherlands East Indies (Indonesia), Indochina, and the Philippines. The naming of this region as South East Asia in these wartime conferences became a widely accepted definition.

## Post-WWII Cooperation

The end of World War II marked a period of economic reconstruction in Asia and the Far East. Regional cooperation emerged as an important initiative during this time, from around 1947 to 1967. Two key organizations that contributed to post-war cooperation and development were the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) and the Colombo Plan.

ECAFE was established in 1947 to promote economic cooperation and accelerate economic growth amongst countries within Asia and the Far East. Headquartered in Bangkok, ECAFE's membership grew to include key nations like China, India, Japan, Australia, and others across South East Asia. ECAFE focused on fostering economic ties by providing technical assistance, operational services, and policy advice. 

The Colombo Plan was founded in 1950 as an intergovernmental organization aimed at furthering economic and social development in Asia and the Pacific. It was set up by commonwealth nations like Australia, Britain, Canada, Ceylon, India, New Zealand, and Pakistan. The Colombo Plan provided member countries with technical assistance grants, training programs, and ad-hoc expert services. By promoting collaborative partnerships, it helped address socio-economic disparities and spur growth.

This post-World War II period was therefore characterized by increased regional cooperation through pioneering organizations like ECAFE and the Colombo Plan. Their establishment marked crucial efforts toward economic reconstruction and addressing developmental gaps in Asia and the Far East.

## Military Alliances 

A key military pact during this period was the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), formed in 1954 and dissolved in 1977. SEATO emerged as an anti-communist alliance, extending beyond just Southeast Asia to include countries like the United States, France, Australia and New Zealand. 

The backdrop of the Cold War meant SEATO served as a collective defense treaty, aiming to prevent the spread of communism in Southeast Asia. SEATO member countries were committed to responding collectively to potential aggression or threats.

While SEATO was devised to addresssecurity concerns, the pact was criticized as lacking a true Southeast Asian character since it included Western powers. SEATO struggled to establish itself as an effective regional organization. The Vietnam War further exposed fissures within the alliance.

By the 1970s, SEATO was increasingly seen as irrelevant, leading to its eventual dissolution. But during its early years, SEATO stood out as a prominent anti-communist military alliance led by Western powers. Its influence underscored the geopolitics of the Cold War era spanning Southeast Asia.

## Early Regional Efforts

In the years leading up to ASEAN's establishment, there were several early regional cooperation efforts within Southeast Asia itself:

**ASA (Association of Southeast Asia)** - Formed in 1961, ASA was comprised of Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. It aimed to foster economic, cultural, technical, and educational cooperation. ASA held annual conferences, but was discontinued in 1967.

**MAPHILINDO** - Launched in 1963, MAPHILINDO was an organization between Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia. It sought political and security cooperation, but dissolved by 1968 due to ethnic tensions and territorial disputes. 

**SEAMEO (Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization)** - Established in 1965, SEAMEO promotes cooperation in education, science, and culture across Southeast Asia. It remains active today with 11 member countries.

**MCEDSEA (Ministers Conference for Economic Development in South East Asia)** - MCEDSEA operated between 1964 and 1967, holding five conferences for economic cooperation among Southeast Asian countries before ASEAN's founding.

**ASPAC (Asian and Pacific Council)** - Formed in 1966, ASPAC was a regional group that included Southeast Asian countries along with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. It focused on economic and technical cooperation before merging into PECC in 1980.

## Pre-ASEAN Landscape

The period leading up to the formation of ASEAN in 1967 was characterized by conflicts, tensions, and a lack of confidence building measures in Southeast Asia. Some key aspects:

- The region saw numerous territorial disputes and border conflicts between countries. For example, Indonesia and Malaysia clashed during Konfrontasi in 1962-1966 over Indonesian opposition to the formation of Malaysia. There were also competing claims over islands and maritime boundaries.
- Military clashes and civil conflicts plagued several Southeast Asian nations, including communist insurgencies in Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, and the Vietnam War with French and later American involvement. These conflicts fueled tensions and mistrust in the region.  
- Countries had relatively limited economic and cultural exchange. Each focused on their own nation building and viewed neighbors with suspicion due to ideological differences, historical animosities, and the interventionist policies of external powers.
- There was no collective regional security architecture prior to 1967. Southeast Asia lacked forums for open dialogue and confidence building measures to promote greater understanding and cooperation.
- Overall, the pre-ASEAN years saw fractured relations, fragile peace and stability, and few avenues for promoting regional solidarity and common interests. Many conflicts centered on containing communist influence as Southeast Asia struggled to emerge from its colonial past.

## Establishment of ASEAN 

The year 1967 marked a significant milestone in the region's history with the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). On 8 August 1967, the foreign ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand came together to sign the ASEAN Declaration in Bangkok. 

The declaration outlined the aims and purposes of the newly formed regional organization, including to accelerate economic growth, promote regional peace and stability, and collaborate in mutual interests. ASEAN provided a formal platform for promoting regional cooperation in a spirit of equality and partnership, moving away from conflicts of the past. 

The founding members of ASEAN recognized that in an increasingly uncertain global environment, with the escalating Vietnam War and spread of communism, it was in their shared interest to band together. ASEAN sought to create a bulwark against external interference in the region, while fostering ties on the basis of mutual understanding and respect for national sovereignty.

## ASEAN Impact

The formation of ASEAN in 1967 marked a pivotal moment for the region, providing a strong foundation for cooperation, economic integration, and stability. 

One of the key achievements of ASEAN has been to foster peace and avoid conflict among member states. ASEAN has served as an important platform for dialogue and confidence-building, reducing tensions that characterized the pre-ASEAN years. Mechanisms like the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation have propagated norms around peaceful conduct and non-interference. This has strengthened political and social stability in the region.

On the economic front, ASEAN economic integration initiatives have boosted trade and investment flows. Intra-regional trade has grown significantly, facilitated by tariff reductions and elimination of non-tariff barriers. The ASEAN Free Trade Area established in 1992 was a major milestone, enabling the free flow of goods. Other landmark agreements include the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services signed in 1995. 

Overall, ASEAN regionalism has supported high economic growth rates across member countries. GDP per capita rose steadily from $312 in 1967 to $3834 in 2015. Infrastructure development and industrialization were also given a boost through ASEAN initiatives. ASEAN's role as an anchor for regional stability has been a key ingredient enabling robust economic progress.

In summary, ASEAN has delivered substantial benefits - underpinning political stability, conflict prevention, and strong economic growth. It has transformed South East Asia into a region characterized by peaceful cooperation rather than tension and discord. ASEAN continues to be the main driving force for further integration and prosperity in the region.

## Conclusion 

Southeast Asia has evolved remarkably over the last century, from a region under colonial rule to one filled with hope and potential. The very term "Southeast Asia" originated from World War II military alliances led by Western powers. However, the post-war period saw a flourishing of regional cooperation and economic development initiatives by Asian nations themselves. 

Early efforts at partnership focused on fostering cultural understanding, educational advancement, and economic growth. While some pacts like SEATO centered on military concerns, the prevailing spirit was one of mutual development and regional identity. These cooperative foundations allowed the establishment of ASEAN in 1967, marking a pivotal moment for peace and stability. 

Now, over 50 years later, ASEAN has grown into a leading force for economic integration and geopolitical coordination in Asia. The colonial-era idea of Southeast Asia has blossomed into a vibrant, diverse region linked by common values and aspirations. By learning from the past while looking to the future, Southeast Asia has transformed into a promising model for regional cooperation and shared prosperity.
