        <p>Hi, I'm Cantika, a graduate from Bina Nusantara University in International Relations major. My fascination lies in parliamentary diplomacy and the broader spectrum of international affairs. When I first started my degree, I was overwhelmed by the amount of information I had to absorb. I was also confused about where to start. I hope this website can help you to get a better understanding of international relations and its related fields. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me through my website. Happy learning!
